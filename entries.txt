What
s
in
your
back
yard
I
m
on
vacation
this
week
so
I
m
posting
some
older
articles
Hope
you
enjoy
this
one
You
ever
think
about
what
is
in
your
back
yard
Might
seem
like
a
bit
of
an
odd
question
but
it
s
one
that
s
been
on
my
mind
recently
It
s
really
pretty
easy
for
me
to
answer
We
ve
got
a
fort
for
the
kids
to
play
on
a
slide
and
a
little
house
for
the
younger
ones
some
lawn
furniture
a
grill
and
a
small
patio
Seems
pretty
typical
doesn
t
it
Now
if
I
just
stopped
there
this
would
make
for
a
pretty
pointless
and
stupid
post
so
I
m
not
going
to
What
s
interesting
to
me
are
the
things
that
I
didn
t
describe
that
are
back
there
things
that
I
don
t
expect
or
want
you
to
see
We
have
a
new
dog
that
s
still
a
bit
of
a
puppy
and
she
likes
to
drag
things
out
the
dog
door
and
into
the
backyard
She
doesn
t
typically
chew
them
up
except
for
shoes
she
just
takes
them
outside
and
deposits
them
between
the
fort
and
the
back
door
One
day
my
wife
and
I
were
talking
while
I
was
driving
home
from
work
and
she
said
Don
t
look
in
the
back
yard
when
you
get
home
Naturally
I
was
curious
why
I
was
being
restricted
like
this
and
she
replied
with
Because
it
looks
like
a
diaper
bomb
went
off
out
there
Apparently
Maggie
had
found
a
trash
can
in
the
bedroom
where
we
had
been
putting
diapers
and
was
taking
them
outside
one
by
one
Now
you
might
be
wondering
why
I
m
telling
you
about
this
and
how
it
relates
to
my
point
You
really
need
to
be
less
like
my
son
watching
a
movie
constantly
asking
about
what
s
going
to
happen
and
be
more
patient
I
m
only
250
words
into
this
When
there
is
stuff
strewn
all
over
the
back
yard
I
hate
going
out
there
It
s
surrounded
by
a
fence
so
nobody
sees
it
and
this
removes
just
about
any
motivation
I
might
have
to
clean
it
up
I
don
t
even
like
mowing
out
there
Normally
nobody
knows
about
this
except
for
my
family
and
it
s
not
a
big
deal
However
last
week
anyone
driving
by
my
house
knew
about
my
lack
of
back
yard
cleanliness
After
a
couple
days
of
strong
winds
and
one
good
storm
my
already
pathetic
fence
gave
up
on
one
side
of
the
house
and
came
crashing
down
I
look
outside
during
the
storm
and
notice
three
fence
panels
on
the
ground
and
two
more
waving
like
fans
at
a
football
game
who
just
realized
the
camera
was
turned
their
direction
I
was
understandably
disappointed
that
I
would
have
to
repair
the
fence
but
I
was
more
disturbed
that
now
people
would
be
able
to
see
into
my
back
yard
and
the
sorry
state
it
was
in
Last
weekend
while
I
was
rebuilding
the
fence
I
had
plenty
of
time
to
think
I
started
to
realize
that
the
way
we
maintain
our
house
could
really
be
a
metaphor
for
our
own
lives
I
try
to
make
sure
that
the
front
yard
is
fairly
well
kept
always
mowed
and
looking
at
least
presentable
The
front
yard
is
like
my
public
life
It
s
lived
out
in
front
of
anyone
who
can
see
it
and
what
goes
on
there
isn
t
hidden
in
the
least
Any
words
I
speak
in
public
are
out
there
for
all
to
hear
My
back
yard
is
a
bit
more
guarded
I
try
to
keep
what
is
going
on
back
there
private
but
it
doesn
t
always
work
as
evidenced
by
my
fence
falling
in
Just
like
that
fence
sometimes
my
guard
is
down
and
people
see
a
bit
more
of
what
I
m
really
like
I
might
try
to
quickly
build
the
fence
back
up
but
once
someone
sees
that
back
yard
of
my
personality
they
probably
won
t
forget
it
especially
if
it
contradicts
what
I
normally
do
My
point
behind
all
this
is
that
we
need
to
be
sure
that
what
we
display
in
the
front
yard
of
our
lives
our
public
face
is
consistent
with
how
we
live
in
the
back
yard
of
our
life
We
expect
privacy
there
but
we
should
also
understand
that
at
any
moment
that
privacy
can
be
broken
and
all
the
things
that
we
try
to
hide
from
public
view
will
be
displayed
for
all
to
see
Luke
12
2
3
tells
us
2
For
there
is
nothing
covered
that
will
not
be
revealed
nor
hidden
that
will
not
be
known
3
Therefore
whatever
you
have
spoken
in
the
dark
will
be
heard
in
the
light
and
what
you
have
spoken
in
the
ear
in
inner
rooms
will
be
proclaimed
on
the
housetops
Let
us
live
our
lives
so
that
what
is
proclaimed
from
the
housetops
is
our
love
for
our
Savior
our
dedication
to
living
our
lives
for
the
calling
He
has
given
to
us
We
are
the
light
of
the
world
shining
like
that
city
on
a
hill
to
make
known
His
sacrifice
for
us
not
for
our
own
glory
but
for
His
Pray
that
we
do
not
let
the
hidden
part
of
our
lives
become
a
hindrance
to
the
spreading
of
His
word

The
slippery
slope
of
morality
The
journey
from
your
mind
into
your
hands
is
shorter
than
you
re
thinking
Be
careful
if
you
think
you
stand
you
just
might
be
sinking
Slow
Fade
Casting
Crowns
The
hard
thing
about
trying
to
be
a
good
moral
person
is
that
you
re
constantly
being
pulled
towards
those
things
you
know
you
shouldn
t
be
involved
in
Temptation
has
a
way
of
dragging
you
back
onto
the
wide
path
when
you
ve
been
trying
to
walk
the
straight
and
narrow
Sometimes
though
you
make
the
choices
yourself
You
see
that
someone
else
is
letting
slide
what
you
think
is
wrong
so
you
begin
to
think
it
s
OK
too
It
could
be
swearing
movies
drinking
just
about
anything
You
start
to
feel
pressure
if
you
re
the
one
that
is
different
from
everyone
else
and
then
you
begin
to
conform
to
the
ways
of
those
around
you
And
do
not
be
conformed
to
this
world
but
be
transformed
by
the
renewing
of
your
mind
that
you
may
prove
what
is
that
good
and
acceptable
and
perfect
will
of
God
Romans
12
2
NKJV
The
little
things
add
up
all
the
time
First
you
decide
to
tell
a
little
white
lie
so
that
you
don
t
get
in
trouble
You
follow
those
with
lies
to
cover
up
the
original
lie
Years
later
you
re
telling
your
spouse
that
you
ve
been
at
the
office
all
day
when
really
you
ve
been
at
a
bar
all
because
it
s
become
more
natural
to
lie
than
to
tell
the
truth
Opening
the
door
to
any
sin
allows
all
sin
to
get
a
foothold
in
your
life
We
ve
got
to
battle
back
sin
with
the
Holy
Spirit
actively
engaging
in
the
fight
and
not
passively
allowing
the
enemy
to
roll
over
us
This
is
something
that
doesn
t
come
natural
to
any
of
us
it
really
is
a
struggle
to
do
However
the
reward
for
fighting
back
the
sin
in
our
lives
is
eternal
Imagine
that
a
worker
notices
a
problem
with
a
dam
holding
back
millions
of
gallons
of
water
Below
that
dam
is
a
quaint
little
town
full
of
people
going
about
their
everyday
lives
If
the
worker
notices
a
small
leak
in
the
dam
should
he
fix
the
leak
or
should
he
just
say
Oh
it
s
just
a
small
leak
it
should
be
fine
Those
millions
of
gallons
of
water
are
now
placing
pressure
on
that
small
leak
causing
it
to
grow
a
little
bigger
with
each
passing
day
Gradually
the
leak
turns
into
a
gaping
hole
allowing
more
water
to
pass
through
causing
some
minor
issues
in
the
little
town
Still
the
worker
says
The
dam
is
still
standing
that
hole
isn
t
causing
much
damage
I
ll
ignore
it
Eventually
the
gaping
hole
gives
way
to
an
actual
dam
break
Millions
of
gallons
of
water
are
rushing
down
the
hill
towards
the
little
town
destroying
everything
in
its
path
The
little
town
is
destroyed
all
the
people
are
injured
or
killed
and
the
dam
worker
justifies
it
by
saying
The
dam
just
broke
Now
let
s
talk
about
sin
this
way
Maybe
you
ve
allowed
a
little
sin
into
your
life
but
you
don
t
want
to
deal
with
it
because
it
s
not
a
big
deal
Everyone
has
small
issues
right
Your
family
doesn
t
know
about
it
and
everything
looks
normal
However
that
sin
is
placing
pressure
on
you
and
on
the
rest
of
your
life
wanting
to
allow
more
sin
to
come
through
Gradually
that
sin
grows
into
something
that
you
and
your
family
notice
but
you
don
t
really
identify
the
cause
of
the
problem
You
continue
to
justify
it
by
saying
that
everyone
is
doing
it
it
ll
be
OK
It
s
not
causing
too
many
problems
in
your
life
so
you
just
let
it
continue
Finally
the
dam
breaks
You
act
out
on
your
sin
in
a
big
way
destroying
your
family
your
reputation
and
your
relationship
with
God
You
might
say
I
don
t
know
what
happened
I
wasn
t
myself
it
just
happened
This
is
what
happens
when
we
allow
sin
to
erode
our
life
Our
familiarity
with
sin
is
unacceptable
to
God
We
cannot
be
friendly
with
sin
and
friendly
with
God
at
the
same
time
Through
prayer
through
devotion
to
Him
God
can
give
us
the
ability
to
overcome
sin
but
we
have
to
make
the
effort
to
do
so
We
have
to
pursue
God
so
that
He
can
renew
our
minds
Are
there
areas
where
you
need
to
battle
back
sin
in
your
life
How
can
I
pray
for
you

Lessons
learned
from
a
week
on
vacation
It
s
been
quite
a
week
We
have
one
more
night
here
at
Walt
Disney
World
then
we
are
headed
home
I
ll
give
you
a
bit
of
a
preview
for
next
week
though
There
are
a
few
things
I
ve
noticed
here
that
develop
into
great
analogies
for
life
lessons
Anything
from
a
large
burly
fellow
with
a
pink
Disney
Princess
backpack
to
using
the
bathroom
at
the
dinner
table
to
the
lack
of
wisdom
in
crowds
I
think
you
ll
enjoy
these
However
today
I
d
like
to
share
with
a
you
a
few
lessons
that
have
been
forcefully
taught
to
me
this
week
Some
painful
some
really
painful
and
some
rather
enjoyable
I
love
that
I
ve
been
able
to
spend
a
week
in
a
single
hotel
room
with
my
wife
and
kids
However
I
m
going
crazy
spending
a
week
in
a
single
hotel
room
with
my
kids
Bedtime
is
the
absolute
craziest
time
of
day
I
don
t
know
if
it
is
the
tired
children
the
tired
parents
or
the
insanity
of
being
in
one
room
but
little
ones
do
not
go
to
sleep
well
this
way
at
least
not
ours
Now
this
is
a
very
first
world
problem
and
I
know
that
I
should
be
thankful
that
I
m
able
to
take
trips
like
this
with
my
children
Don
t
misunderstand
me
because
I
am
very
thankful
for
that
The
simple
fact
remains
that
it
is
so
far
out
of
the
ordinary
for
us
as
to
be
uncomfortable
and
even
more
tiring
The
second
thing
I
ve
learned
is
that
you
can
tell
how
many
days
people
have
been
here
just
by
the
look
on
their
faces
There
is
an
unspoken
I
ve
sat
through
It
s
A
Small
World
so
many
times
that
i
might
just
twist
off
at
the
next
puppet
I
see
look
to
some
faces
These
are
the
people
that
are
not
hardcore
Disney
fans
but
came
mostly
for
their
children
An
aside
you
know
what
would
make
Small
World
so
much
better
Bucket
o
softballs
You
ll
have
to
create
a
queue
that
would
stretch
all
the
way
across
the
park
for
it
So
many
childhood
doll
nightmares
erased
in
a
hail
of
tossed
balls
It
s
a
goldmine
I
expect
my
royalty
checks
to
pour
in
soon
Too
many
people
come
here
with
the
expectation
that
they
can
accomplish
everything
at
WDW
in
a
week
This
is
so
far
from
the
truth
My
wife
and
I
have
been
coming
here
since
1996
and
we
ve
still
not
seen
or
done
it
all
The
likelihood
is
pretty
slim
that
it
will
happen
too
Too
many
things
changing
or
disappearing
to
be
able
to
conquer
that
mountain
The
one
lasting
memory
I
have
from
our
trips
to
WDW
is
the
sense
of
awe
that
my
children
feel
Heck
I
feel
it
too
Everything
here
is
so
much
bigger
so
much
more
perfect
than
the
real
world
Of
course
if
it
weren
t
that
way
we
wouldn
t
be
paying
to
visit
If
someone
built
a
Computer
Progeammer
World
I
d
have
to
be
drugged
to
be
taken
in
to
it
I
don
t
want
my
real
life
I
want
a
different
reality
That
might
be
good
sometimes
but
it
definitely
isn
t
a
way
to
live
Finally
it
appears
to
me
that
while
they
are
here
people
become
a
clearer
more
exact
picture
of
themselves
due
to
the
money
and
time
spent
and
emotional
and
physical
investment
paid
to
be
here
Vacations
especially
big
ones
like
WDW
have
a
way
of
refining
our
personalities
in
a
way
that
other
experiences
don
t
I
ve
seen
adults
act
like
complete
children
and
complete
jerks
I
ve
seen
children
be
perfect
angels
and
ceaseless
terrors
and
you
should
have
seen
everyone
else
s
kids
too
I
m
sure
that
I
exhibit
some
of
this
too
We
are
who
we
are
and
exhaustion
makes
the
pretensions
go
away
All
in
all
it
s
been
a
great
time
here
I
m
anxious
to
start
home
and
return
to
my
own
reality
though
Too
many
exciting
things
coming
up
in
the
next
few
weeks
that
I
don
t
want
to
miss
I
hope
you
come
back
again
next
week
for
my
Observations
on
the
World
series

The

This

as

DNA
treatment
is
the
latest
tactic
to
locate

for

What

What
is
a
HIV
The
unanticipated
accomplishment
of
the
Berlin
enduring
plots
the
HIV
study
society
however
whatever
faded
wish
that
was
produced
from
it
was
bootlace
with
a
deep
dose
of
cynicism
of
great
akin
operational
on
a
common
root
What
is
a
HIV
Zinc
touch
nucleases
can
be
the
input
What
is
a
HIV
these
nucleases
are
finally
copied
proteins
allocating
the
cellular
DNA
to
be
score
at
sure
exact
positions
What
is

HIV
they
were
worn
in
a
medical
trial
faceting
HIV
infected
those
with
untraceable
viral
many
but
small
T
cell
tally
What
is
a
HIV
the
modified
nucleases
were
engineered
to
attach
to
DNA
series
in
the
CCR5
DNA
in
the
impure
patient
s
T
cells
What
is
a
HIV
the
CCR5
DNA
has
an
alteration
in
it
in
a
little
proportion
of
persons
that
permits
the
individual
with
the
change
to
be
enduringly
anti
to
HIV
What
is
a
HIV
The
pre
cut
nucleases
incise
off
the
CCR5
DNA
and
restore
it
with
an
original
alteration
production
the
cubicle
defiant
to
HIV
virus
What
is
a
HIV
The
ordinary
CCR5
alteration
was
the
equal
one
specified
to
the
HIV
infected
Berlin
Patient
in
a
fillet
core
remove
for
leukemia
that
resulted
serendipitously
in
the
tolerant
suitable
HIV
free
as
well
What
is
a
HIV
this
process
efforts
to
do
is
duplicate
what
that
little
proportion
of
citizens
are
obviously
natural
with
provide
a
normal
confrontation
to
HIV
inside
the
body
What
is
a
HIV
The
process
itself
was
well
received
in
all
the
patients
and
five
of
the
six
patients
in
the
learn
augmented
their
T
cell
tally
after
the
process
What
is
a
HIV
the
customized
cells
also
traveled
obviously
to
the
raze
where
a
main
HIV
tank
dwell
these
cells
were
also
unwilling
to
HIV
as
well
What
is

The
transformation
remove
the
CCR5
DNA
totally
and
that
s
what
creates
the
cells
defiant
What
is
a
HIV
As
moment
goes
on
this
practice
will
be
inspected
in
revisions
of
superior
model
sizes
What
is
a
HIV
This
notable
verdict
can
be
the
one
mania
we
want
to
lastly
expand
a

for
HIV
purposeful

or
both
it
doesn
t
subject
at
this
spot
now
as
long
as
a
therapy
is
gained
What
is
a
HIV
If
these
zinc
touch
nucleases
could
repeat
the
alteration
of
the
CCR5
DNA
and
that
is
a
receive
signal
for
the
millions

The

of
a

hush

conveniences
that
are
for
the

Most

frequently
the
foremost
summit
of
admission
when
there
are
any
healthcare
apprehensions
earlier
than
transfers
to
any

health
organization
if
essential
There
are
thousands
of
indemnity

that
wrap

indemnity
and
up
unless
quite
lately
it
has
been
very
solid
to
obtain
healthcare
cover
to
wrap
autism
as
it
is
dangerous
and

is
extremely
luxurious
This

has
lately
distorted

The

There

Healthcare

that
might

as
it

healthcare
agenda
An
assessment
and
appraisal
of
the
child
might
be
completed
by
a
multidisciplinary
healthcare
side
of
experts
Health
center
who
focus
in
autism
will
watch
the
healthcare
child
ask
parents
queries
about
the
child
s
growth
healthcare
and
performance
and
do
a
diversity
of
examinations
such

cleverness
examinations
to
assess
the

s

and

The

are
a

Since
our
clever
administrations
stay
wounding
community
expenditure
health
care
center
being
clever
to
give
polite
health
care
center
has
befall
a
lot
extra
demanding
starting
the
frequent
man
Now
it
is
not
presently
the
patients
that
are
leaving
to
sense
the
warmth
of
the
new
severity
events
as
still
health
care
center
amenities
are
predictable
to
observer
a
reduce
speed
As
the
expenditure
rule
of
the
ordinary
man
is
leaving
down
a
vast
chore
of
the
give
of
health
care
center
amenities
is
to
competition
their
accuse
as
for
each
the
expenditure
authority
of
the
people
As
they
say
all
has
two
sides
if
you
are
the
proprietor
or
the
boss
of
health
care
center
aptitude
the
monetary
hold
up
may
extremely
healthy
work
for
your
health
care
center
quite
than
ready
beside
it
This
is
as
if
you
lower
the
accuse
of
the
action
you
present
you
will
be
able
to
draw
a
great
contract
better
figure
of
health
care
center
patients
than
you
typically
do
However
the
query
that
arises
here
is
how
on
soil
you
can
inferior
the
accuse
when
the
cost
of
all
are
leaving
up
Although
this
might
hum
impracticable
with
the
authority
of
the
mesh
you
can
absolutely
attain
health
care
center
this
No
substance
whether
you
require
to
purchase
med
provisions
or
lab
provisions
you
use
a
substantial
quantity
of
cash
Now
you
might
extremely
healthy
contain
a
dependable
checkup
and
surgical
tools
dealer
to
get
mind
of
each
require
you
health
care
center
ability
has
however
if
you
purchase
the
necessary
provisions
from
a
net
base
dealer
you
can
very
well
knowledge
a
considerable
dissimilarity
in
your
expenditure
When
you
purchase
the
necessary
provisions
as
of
a
restricted
medicinal
and
surgical
gear
dealer
in
adding
to
paying
for
the
provisions
you
also
disburse
health
care
center
a
fraction
of
the
preservation
accountable
on
the
dealer
However
if
you
purchase
the
necessary
health
care
center
provisions
starting
a
web
based
mercantile
you
are
not
necessary
to
disburse
for
such
operating
price
as
health
care
center
online
merchants
do
not
have
any
such
operating
cost
Hence
by
economy
on
the
buy
of
the
provisions
you
can
simply
make
a
fiscal
bumper
to
inferior
the
accuse
of
health
care
center
the
action
you
have
to
present
although
near
marketplace
is
the
most
outstanding
put
to
buy
all
variety
from
foodstuff
to
med
provisions
you
require
to
health
care
center
confirm
whether
or
not
the
gathering
you
are
trading
the
provisions
from
is
genuine

Health
care
issues
There
are
more
than
a
few
health
care
issues
that
are
in
the
news
bulletin
and
in
the
intelligences
of
lots
of
people
these
days
maybe
for
the
reason
that
of
the
set
in
movement
for
worldwide
health
care
issues
mistreatment
of
the
present
health
care
issues
scheme
have
approached
to
light
The
health
care
issues
that
pestilence
Americans
require
to
be
talked
to
with
bright
discuss
and
sympathetic
One
of
the
health
care
issues
is
the
do
to
excess
of
crisis
accommodation
by
the
deprived
It
is
not
their
errors
They
are
just
reacting
to
a
state
of
affairs
in
which
they
have
no
other
way
out
For
case
in
point
a
low
income
family
may
well
have
a
youngster
with
a
slash
handle
If
they
had
indemnity
the
parents
would
get
the
young
person
to
a
doctor
s
office
place
of
work
or
an
urgent
health
care
issues
health
center
to
get
a
hold
the
toy
with
sewed
up
Seeing
as
they
have
no
such
alternative
they
get
the
a
great
deal
additional
valuable
path
of
disappearing
to
the
urgent
situation
space
for
the
similar
service
This
places
a
damage
on
crisis
accommodation
and
expenses
taxpayers
a
great
deal
additional
than
if
the
deprived
families
were
prearranged
sufficient
health
check
reporting
in
the
primary
put
Health
care
issues
similar
to
this
one
are
hard
to
figure
out
when
there
are
so
a
lot
of
basses
of
cheaper
checkup
mind
Other
health
care
issues
engage
pre
emptive
drug
Indemnity
corporation
do
not
all
hold
up
the
patient
s
correct
to
pre
emptive
checkup
show
events
and
actions
This
also
creates
health
care
additional
luxurious
in
the
extended
sprint
A
lot
of
health
care
issues
rotate
approximately
the
older
inhabitants
There
are
so
many
elderly
people
who
are
known
small
or
no
assist
with
their
instruction
medication
Indemnity
Corporation
creates
medicine
reporting
obtainable
at
a
cost
that
is
so
far
above
the
ground
that
the
majority
older
cannot
have
enough
money
it
This
does
small
to
make
your
mind
up
these
health
care
issues
With
all
the
health
care
issues
that
are
in
the
community
eye
there
wants
to
be
an
improved
organization
of
message
on
these
topics
Populace
can
have
a
crash
on
their
health
care
issues
organization
if
they
discern
where
to
have
their
thoughts
on
health

issues
listen
to
It
is

for

and
other

Health
care
problems
Previous
to
the
way
of
the
new
Health
Bill
the
United
States
was
expenditure
2
1
trillion
a
Health
care
problems
year
on
health
care
problems
a
cost
of
7
026
for
each
individual
in
the
state
Health
care
problems
16
percent
of
the
nationwide
financial
system
and
these
expenses
are
motionless
increasing
One
of
the
main
problems
are
that
health
care
problems
are
a
labyrinth
of
official
procedure
you
wait
two
days
in
the
sanatorium
and
you
obtain
this
invoice
that
seems
similar
to
the
Kansas
City
Star
Sunday
Newspaper
if
you
are
covered
all
we
observe
is
how
a
great
deal
you
have
to
disburse
and
by
no
means
query
health
care
problems
some
accuses
Too
a
lot
of
periods
there
are
needless
examinations
exaggerated
costs
emotionally
involved
to
crops
and
needless
services
as
fraction
of
this
listed
labyrinth
At
era
an
exacting
price
might
be
a
tip
of
conversation
with
our
health
care
problems
associates
they
emotional
me
10
00
a
part
for
hygienic
napkins
but
we
by
no
means
follows
these
accuses
The
cover
corporation
will
grasp
that
we
speak
and
zero
additional
is
supposed
but
then
the
indemnity
corporation
lifts
health
care
problems
your
taxes
and
you
complaints
This
is
too
frequently
the
situation
and
it
has
health
care
problems
reason
our
rates
to
the
heavens
soar
we
not
at
all
responsibility
the
health
suppliers
its
forever
the
indemnity
corporation
as
organism
the
awful
guys
A
buddy
of
pit
was
expectant
she
had
difficulties
and
the
baby
was
born
three
months
early
It
was
health
care
problems
an
extended
demanding
instance
for
the
family
as
the
baby
necessary
a
spirit
check
and
a
24
hour
timepiece
Following
some
weeks
of
unadulterated
torture
the
baby
was
out
of
hazard
but
the
sanatorium
and
physician
statement
health
care
problems
besieged
them
and
they
had
to
health
care
problems
folder
for
insolvent
They
struggled
to
discuss
an
imbursement
agenda
but
the
expenditure
was
unfeasible
Throughout
the
discussions
they
queried
several
of
the
accuse
one
examination
had
a
cost
tag
of
1200
00
dollars
The
sanatorium
secretarial
clerk
informed
them
health
care
problems
that
if
the
sanatoriums
identified
they
did
not
have
cover
they
would
have
in
no
way
achieved
mortal
aware
of
health
care
problems
accuses
are
a
blame

one
of
the
main
bases
in

Several
would

Uterine
Cancer
Uterine
Cancer
Uterine
Cancer
Endometrial
Cancer
or
Uterine
Cancer
is
reason
by
cancer
cell
enlargement
straight
on
the
coating
of
the
uterus
The
majority
women
error
the
vaginal
blood
loss
to
be
reason
by
menopause
Uterine
cancer
Fallacy
is
quite
ordinary
We
are
going
away
to
observe
several
symptoms
that
might
or
may
not
point
to
uterine
cancer
They
can
be
sourced
owed
to
additional
problems
too
To
corroborate
whether
some
of
these
symptoms
really
guides
to
uterine
cancer
you
must
leave
to
a
physician
to
corroborate
Several
of
the
Uterine
Cancer
symptoms
that
have
been
experiential
in
uterine
cancer
patients
Ache
in
the
pelvic
region
Ache
while
urinating
Blood
loss
from
the
vaginal
area
Complexity
while
urinating
Free
from
the
vagina
Sore
feeling
while
spoiling
in
sexual
contact
Learns
have
exposed
that
blood
loss
from
the
Uterine
Cancer
vagina
is
the
majority
ordinary
kind
of
Uterine
Cancer
symptoms
that
have
been
experiential
Originally
there
may
not
be
hemorrhage
quite
a
free
This
will
twist
to
blood
loss
later
Kinds
who
are
the
majority
flat
to
uterine
cancer
Women
old
50
years
or
extra
Endometrial
hyperplasia
Women
who
have
an
add
to
in
their
hormones
This
Uterine
Cancer
might
be
women
who
have
fewer
children
who
have
had
ovarian
cancer
or
undergone
treatment
for
estrogen
substitute
Uterine
Cancer
The
action
Uterine
Cancer
is
not
the
similar
for
all
women
Numerous
issues
have
to
be
full
into
thought
Parts
similar
to
age
proceed
of
the
Uterine
Cancer
etc
have
to
be
reserved
in
intelligence
Action
is
either
one
or
a
mixture
of
these
operation
radiotherapy
and
chemotherapy
In
the
first
phase
if
the
increase
of
the
Uterine
Cancer
is
not
that
higher
doctor
s
office
will
attempt
to
totally
eliminate
the
cancerous
cubicle
from
the
woman
s
uterus
If
the
Uterine
Cancer
illness
has
development
usually
there
is
some
Uterine
Cancer
operation
down
with
chemo
or
radiotherapy
This
assists
to
end
the
enlargement
of
cancerous
cells
in
other
fraction
of
the
body
Note
If
you
or
in
your
family

disappointed

disease
which
is
treatment
less

so
cup
shredded
mozzarella
2
oz
I
don
t
know
if
I
use
2
oz

think
looks
good

tablespoon
grated

I
ve
talked
about
this
before
the
miraculous
discovery
that
my
kitchen
aid
paddle
attachment
will
shred
chicken
No
more
forks
and
aching
hands
Throw
it
in
chop
it
up
and
you
re
done
But
just
in
case
you
don
t
believe
me
because
it
definitely
sounds
too
good
to
be
true
here
s
the
proof
Boil
the
chicken
Remove
from
pan
and
place
on
cutting
board
Cut
chicken
breasts
into
halves
I
don
t
know
if
you
absolutely
have
to
do
this
but
I
did
Put
the
chicken
in
the
kitchen
aid
bowl
with
the
paddle
attachment
Process
the
chicken
for
about
45
seconds
on
low
speed
And
there
you
have
it
beautifully
shredded
chicken
in
a
fraction
of
the
time
it
takes
with
two
forks
If
I
hadn
t
seen
it
with
my
own
eyes
I
wouldn
t
have
believed
it
I
have
a
friend
who
has
a
stand
up
mixer
that
isn
t
a
Kitchen
Aid
Her
mixer
has
two
beaters
instead
of
one
paddle
She
tried
shredding
her
chicken
with
her
mixer
and
it
worked
just
fine
So
next
time
you
need
shredded
chicken
skip
the
forks
and
use
your
Kitchen
Aid
It
s
a
miracle

How
to
Use
Herbs
Spices
Posted
on
December

2011

Patty
G
Can
you
imagine
foods
without
any
herbs
or
spices
Not
a
pleasant
thought
at
all
Herbs
and
spices
make
our
food
taste
delicious
It
s
fun
to
experiment
with
different
combinations
and
sometimes
our
experiments
work
and
sometimes
they
don
t
So
in
order
to
increase
our
chances
for
success
as
we
experiment
I
ve
created
a
chart
listing
many
of
the
common
herbs
and
spices
and
how
they
can
be
used
I
also
included
at
the
end
of
the
chart
some
other
specialty
spices
I
have
in
my
collection
and
where
you
can
get
more
information
about
them
My
personal
favorite
is
Chef
Paul
Prudhomme
s
Herbal
Pizza
Pasta
Magic
I
use
this
spice
every
time
I
make
pizza
In
fact
I
sprinkle
it
on
the
dough
and
skip
the
sauce
It
s
delicious
My
daughter
and
daughter
in
law
use
the
spice
in
addition
to
their
sauce
However
you
use
it
it
s
awesome
Now
before
you
take
a
look
at
the
chart
here
are
a
few
interesting
facts
I
discovered
while
I
was
doing
research
Did
you
know
You
can
make
your
own
seasoned
salt
using
this
recipe
cup
salt
1
tablespoon
celery
salt
1
tablespoon
garlic
salt
1
tablespoon
paprika
1
teaspoon
onion
powder
1
teaspoon
dry
mustard
1
teaspoon
pepper
Mix
ingredients
in
a
blender
for
20
seconds
store
in
a
tightly
covered
container
The
difference
between
black
pepper
and
white
pepper
is
that
black
pepper
is
ground
peppercorns
the
dried
berries
of
the
pepper
vine
and
white
pepper
is
ground
from
ripened
berries
of
the
pepper
vine
before
they
re
dried
but
after
the
husks
have
been
removed
White
pepper
is
slightly
less
spicy
than
black
pepper
It
s
used
to
season
bland
light
colored
foods
such
as
eggs
cream
soups
and
sauces
dishes
which
might
not
look
so
appetizing
with
specks
of
black
pepper
The
difference
between
red
pepper
and
paprika
is
that
red
pepper
also
called
cayenne
pepper
is
ground
from
dried
chili
peppers
and
is
pungent
and
hot
while
paprika
is
ground
from
certain
varieties
of
sweet
red
peppers
and
has
a
sweet
flavor
although
it
may
be
quite
hot
1
teaspoon
dried
herbs
from
the
can
or
jar
1
tablespoon
fresh
herbs
Dried
herbs
have
a
stronger
flavor
if
you
crush
them
between
your
fingers
before
adding
them
to
food
Herbs
and
spices
are
not
the
same
Herbs
are
leafy
green
plant
parts
used
for
flavoring
or
as
a
garnish
Spices
are
dried
seeds
fruits
roots
barks
or
vegetative
substances
used
in
small
amounts
as
food
additives
for
flavor
color
or
preservatives
And
as
promised
here

chart

This
is
a
really
good
recipe
one
of
my
favorites
but
it
does
take
a
little
time
It
s
not
hard
the
steak
just
has
to
cook
for
a
while
That
being
said
I
made
this
once
in
the
crock
pot
and
it
turned
out
just
as
good
I
ll
provide
crock
pot
directions
at
the
end
in
case
you
want
to
try
it
that
way
2
pounds
round
steak
3
tbsp
flour
cup
margarine
1
can
petite
diced
tomatoes
1
1
2
tsp
salt
2
to
4
tsp
basil
leaves
1
8
tsp
pepper
c
chopped
onions
c
green
pepper
diced
I
use
the
whole
green
pepper
1
1
2
cups
mozzarella
shredded
Cut
meat
in
serving
sized
pieces
Coat
with
flour
In
a
large
covered
skillet
melt
the
margarine
and
brown
meat
slowly
on
both
sides
Add
tomatoes
salt
basil
and
pepper
Cover
and
simmer
one
hour
Add
onions
and
green
pepper
Cook
30
more
minutes
or
until
meat
is
tender
Top
meat
with
cheese
Heat
until
cheese
melts
Crock
Pot
Directions
You
can
either
brown
the
meat
in
the
skillet
or
skip
that
step
it
s
up
to
you
Either
way
works
I
did
not
brown
my
meat
in
the

In
my
opinion
that
eliminates
some
of
the
benefit
of
the
crock
pot
I
just
want
to
throw
everything
in
and
be
done
with
it
Grease
your
crock
pot
with
pam
Mix
the
tomatoes
salt
basil
pepper
onions
and
green
pepper
together
Layer
as
follows
serving

spread

Remaining

Remaining

Cover

Warehouse
shopping
such
as
at
Costco
and
Sam
s
can
be
a
great
way
to
save
money
but
it
can
also
lead
to
the
destruction
of
a
good
grocery
budget
It
all
depends
on
how
you
shop
there
First
let
s
look
at
the
cost
and
benefits
of
a
membership
A
membership
to
Sam
s
costs
40
or
100
per
year
depending
on
the
type
of
membership
you
chose
The
Advantage
membership
is
40
and
allows
for
2
cardholders
and
the
ability
to
purchase
products
in
store
and
online
The
Advantage
Plus
is
100
and
allows
for
2
card
holders
extended
shopping
hours
extra
coupons
and
a
percentage
of
savings
on
generic
and
name
brand
prescriptions
Costo
s
membership
ranges
from
55
110
per
year
The
Gold
Star
membership
is
55
and
allows
for
2
card
holders
extra
coupons
mailed
to
you
monthly
and
the
ability
to
purchase
in
store
and
online
The
Executive
Gold
Star
membership
is
110
and
allows
for
2
card
holders
extra
coupons
in
the
mail
and
2
cash
back
on
all
purchases
throughout
the
year
You
will
get
a
check
at
the
end
of
the
year
for
your
percentage
back
If
the
total
does
not
equal
55
you
can
take
your
check
in
and
they
will
refund
the
difference
Outside
the
normal
expected
goods
at
warehouses
they
also
have
excellent
competitive
prices
on
prescriptions
tires
contact
lenses
glasses
and
much
more
Throughout
the
year
you
can
find
excellent
prices
on
toys
books
clothing
Halloween
costumes
movies
and
CDs
and
specialty
items
Our
family
has
a
membership
to
Costco
and
we
figured
out
that
if
we
only
bought
milk
there
regularly
we
would
pay
for
our
membership
2
5x
in
a
year
with
the
amount
we
save
And
now
I
want
to
tell
you
the
secret
to
saving
at
warehouses
Are
you
listening
very
closely
It
s
all
about
what
you
buy
and
knowing
your
prices
Just
because
something
is
sold
at
a
warehouse
does
NOT
mean
it
s
a
better
deal
than
your
neighborhood
grocery
store
You
must
look
at
the
unit
price
to
see
if
it
s
a
better
deal
If
you
aren
t
familiar
with
that
term
unit
price
is
figured
by
calculating
the
total
price
times
the
number
of
items
the
package
contains
I
often
pull
out
my
calculator
and
check
unit
prices
while
I
m
at
Costco
to
compare
it
to
what
I
know
the
grocery
store
price
is
to
see
if
it
s
a
better
deal
Some
people
hesitate
to
shop
at
warehouses
because
the
quantities
are
often
so
large
If
you
have
room
in
your
pantry
or
freezer
and
your
family
will
consume
something
in
reasonable
time
then
it
might
be
well
worth
it
Another
way
to
get
around
the
large
quantity
is
going
in
with
a
friend
to
split
the
purchase
My
sister
in
law
and
I
have
shared
huge
packages
of
toilet
paper
fruit
and
other
things
to
help
us
both
with
our
budgets
and
storage
space
Bottom
line
when
you
re
warehouse
shopping
go
with
a
list
and
a
set
amount
to
spend
and
stick
with
it
This
week
s
challenge
If
you
re
a
warehouse
member
try
calculating
this
week
to
see
if
what
you
are
buying
is
really
a
better
deal
than
the
grocery
store
If
you
aren
t
already
a
member
ask
a
friend
who
is
if
you
can
accompany
them
Sometimes
you
can
also
get
a
guest
pass
for
a
day
to
test
out
a
membership

My
parents
have
a
costco
membership
They
buy
their
gas
there
and
my
dad
calculated
they
save
90
00
year
just
from
gas
I
have
a
sam
s
mbrshp
and
I
m
not
sure
if
we
re
saving
as
much
as
we
could
because
I
just
don
t
like
driving
over
there
but
I
do
try
to
buy
milk
there
as
often
as
I
can
Also
produce
is
cheap
and
I
only
buy
their
butter

I
hadn
t
thought
about
the
gas
savings
but
that
is
usually
around
05
cents
less
per
gallon
all
the
time
And
you
re
right
they
have
excellent
produce

More
facts

apparently

talk
of
the
town

is
very
friendly

his
fans

communication
whilst
on
stage
shakes
their
hands
and
always
smiles
he
is
a
media
sweetheart
The
other
fact
of
Another
Greyson
fact
he
loves
soccer
tennis
and
golf
he
also
took
a
role
in
a
Fox
comedy
series
Raising
Hope

is
Christina
Aguilera
John
Lennon
Elton
John

a
Harry

Nerd
and
he
loves
dogs
One
of
his
biggest
dreams

At
a
very
young

with
very
much
talent
he
has
been
praised
and
has
been
given
numbers
of
award
nominations
During

2011
he

5

is
a
remarkable
number
for

new

Neelam
Vaswani
the
Marygops
Marketing
director
stated
I
was
shocked
to
see
that
a
14
year
old
boy
could
sing
with
such
a
deep
voice
I
cannot
imagine
how
his
fans
reacted
when
he
came
for
the
showcase
We
are
very
happy
to
be
able
to
bring
him
back
for
a
full
concert
When
one
listens
to
Greyson
s
songs
it
is
impossible
to
portray
him
as
a
teenager
most
of
the
lyrics
show
maturity
of
the
human
soul
his
voice
is
solid
it
is
likely
to
be
impossible
for
a
boy
his
age
to
have
experienced
the
stories
behind
all
his
lyrics
but
that
is
what
makes
him
unique
his
ability
to
put
his
empathy
into
the
words
he
sings
with
passion
and
he
will
emerge
as
a
star
with
most
potential
We
at
Marygops
are
happy
that
we
could
bring
such
a
talented
young
person
Greyson
for
us
to
hold
his
concert
here
The
showcase
was
a
very
successful
one
and
I
am
sure
the
concert
will
be
the
same
He
not
only
mesmerized
all
the
young
girls
but
his
talent
really
does
appeal
to
ones
that
love
music
The
concert
will
be
filledwith
surprises
and
I
am
positive
it
will
be
one
of
the
best
concerts
you
will
see
Peter
Harjani
Project
and
Creative
Director

And
once
again
no
one

Don
t
worry
everyone
s
favorite
RINO
Ron
Paul
is
still
doing
just
dandy
but
according
to
MSNBC
a
group
of
anti
poaching
conservationists
in
South
Africa
accidentally
killed
the
real
rhinoceros
they
were
using
to
demonstrate
how
to
protects
rhinos
from
poachers
The
20
year
old
rhino
named
Spencer
was
shot
with
a
tranquilizer
gun
in
front
of
a
crowd
of
reporters
by
members
of
the
Rhino
Rescue
Project
who
were
documenting
a
process
used
to
identify
protected
animals
and
deter
poachers
from
killing
them
for
their
horns
After
he
was
tranquilized
Spencer
s
horn
was
to
be
treated
with
a
dye
and
an
insecticide
and
a
tracking
device
was
going
to
be
inserted
as
well
Unfortunately
Spencer
never
woke
up
The
rhino
had
an
unfortunate
reaction
to
the
anesthesia
said
Rhino
Rescue
Project
spokeswoman
Lorinda
Hern
Every
time
you
dart
a
rhino
you
take
a
risk
that
the
rhino
might
not
wake
up
and
unfortunately
today
was
one
of
those
days
Maybe
they
could
have
just
used
life
like
sculptures
A
record
448
rhinos
were
killed
by
poachers
last
year
in
South
Africa
home
to
the
greatest
number
of
the
animals
Hern
says
she
blames
Spencer
s
death
on
those
poachers
It
s
sad
for
us
it
s
the
loss
of
another
animal
It
s
a
death
that
I
still
chalk
up
to
poaching
Next
time
maybe
they
should
take
a
page
from
zoo
keepers
and
police
at
the
Ueno
Zoo
in
Tokyo
and
do
all
their
homework
on
rhinos
before
messing
with
them

about
the
risks
of

for

the

of

Rhino
as

then
blamed

Maybe
they

since
it

lethal

You

Granted
Gothamist
screwed
up
the
story
by
writing
it
up
in
the
snarkiest
most
sensationalistic
way
possible
but
clearly
the
conservationists
were
following
their
standard
routine
Ian
MacAllen
got
it
right
in
his
comment
above
They
wouldn
t
need
a
tracking
device
on
every
rhino
if
there
weren
t
poachers
farleft
You
re
getting
as
bad
as
felix
Hey
man
that
was
below
the
belt
Now
I
admit
I
m
not
versed
on
the
methods
used
to
sedate
and
track
rhinos
but
I
do
know
that
it
is
not
unusual
for
animals
to
get
tranquilized
with
the
wrong
dosage
thereby
killing
the
animal
The
spokesperson
said
that
the
Rhino
had
an
unfortunate
reaction
to
the
anesthesia
but
how
does
she
know
this
was
the
cause
of
death
Did
she
conduct
an
autopsy
Or
is
this
just
her
assumption
I
suppose
it
s
certainly
possible
that
she
s
right
but
I
didn
t
read
anywhere
in
the
article
about
how
she
confirmed
this
Innocent
until
proven
guilty
fine
but
let
s
see
some
tests
before
they
re
completely
off
the
hook
Spirit
of

I
m
sure
they
knew
what
they
were
doing
If
you
read
the

they

Do
you
really
think
any
conservation
group
would
be
dumb
enough
to
say
Let
s
try
something
we
re
unfamiliar
with
and
invite
the
press
to
watch
it
all
Any
vet
even
stateside
will
tell
you
knocking
out
an
animal
is
always
a
risk
That
s
why
good
vets
will
avoid
general
anesthesia
if
at
all
possible
My
vet
once
went
into
an
X
ray
room
to
calm
and
hold
my
cat
while
the
X
ray
was
taken
because
she
didn

to

using

do

Brian
Cashman
s
Alleged
Stalker
Claims
He
Knew
About
Yankees
Steroid
Abuse
The
single
mother
who
was
arrested
last
week
and
charged
with
harassing
and
stalking
Yankees
general
manager
Brian
Cashman
amidst
her
claims
that
she
had
been
Cashman
s
mistress
since
last
April
has
levied
new
charges
against
Cashman
Louise
Neathway
who
also
goes
by
the
last
name
Meanwell
claimed
to
the
Daily
News
that
Cashman
confided
in
her
that
he
purposefully
misled
federal
investigators
about
whether
Yankees
brass
knew
certain
players
used
steroids
Cashman
s
spokesman
Chris
Giglio
vehemently
denied
the
accusations
These
claims
are
complete
and
utter
fiction
the
latest
installment
of
a
carefully
concocted
campaign
of
harassment
now
spewing
from
a
jail
cell
by
a
person
who
is
being
held
on
serious
criminal
felony
charges
of
harassment
and
extortion
Giglio
said
Neathway
has
already
sent
an
email
to
Ron
Gardella
chief
investigator
for
the
U
S
Attorney
s
Office
for
the
Southern
District
of
New
York
and
FBI
agent
Brian
Jacob
advising
them
of
her
claims
In
that
email
she
said
she
had
specific
details
on
dates
and
times
that
Cashman
was
aware
of
steroid
use
by
players
Neathway
has
been
charged
with
grand
larceny
attempted
grand
larceny
stalking
and
aggravated
harassment
Among
other
things
Cashman
s
lawyers
say
the
36
year
old
British
national
was
an
unhinged
con
woman
out
to
extort
him
bombarding
him
with
text
messages
and
calls
during
the
past
10
months
She
allegedly
tried
to
blackmail
him
into
paying
for
a
15
000
medical
treatment
threatening
to
contact
the
press
and
his
family
if
he
didn
t
Cashman
says
he
eventually
caved
and
gave
her
6
000
in
different
bank
accounts
before
contacting
police
Manhattan
prosecutors
have
now
subpoenaed
Cashman
s
bank
records
which
Post
sources
say
include
evidence
that
he
gave
her
as
much
as
20
000
to
Neathway
in
order
to
determine
whether
she
truly
was
extorting
him
for
months
or
if
they
were
legitimate
gifts
as
part
of
an
affair
Neathway
who
has
13
orders
of
protection
against
her
since
1998
has
been
characterized
by
her
exes
as
ruthless
intimidating
and
conniving
Neathway
claimed
Cashman
had
gotten
her
pregnant
but
an
ultrasound
she
emailed
him
was
ultimately
proven
to
be
a
fake
and
Neathway
s
mother
said
she
was
never
pregnant
and
had
lied
about
it
in
the
past
as
well
Former
boyfriend
David
Sano
told
the
Post
he
went
through
a
very
similar
situation
with
her
a
decade
ago
their
relationship
started
after
she
claimed
she
was
pregnant
after
a
one
night
stand
and
ended
around
the
time
she
personally
delivered
a
sex
tape
featuring
Sano
and
his
former
schoolteacher
girlfriend
to
the
headmaster
of
the
Christian
school
where
the
woman
worked
That
s
what
Louise
does
Sano
said
She
takes
pleasure
in
other
people
s
pain

I
am

just
not

I

Mordicai
I
assume
that
they
meant
relatively
cheap
Not
to
mention
organs
in
the
main
are
generally
cheap
as
I
understand
it
From
a
supply
side
I
mean
Since
there
isn
t
as
much
demand
I
guess
you
could
pass
those
savings
down
to
the
customer
the
alchemy
of
a

is
only
about
raw
materials
so
much
you
know
Christopher
Robbins
Yeah
Frank
was
saying
how
tough
it
was
to
get
stuff
like
offal
and
brains
because
no
one
really
wants
it
so
most
butchers
just
throw
it
away
A
benefit
to
using
a
whole
animal
as
Sauce
does
is
that
he
can
choose
to
cut
it
however
he
wants
and
when
the
brains
look
good
they
go
up
on
the
specials
board
Mordicai

my

made

we

What
How
did

heart
he
pointed

it

This
is
a
ferry
service
company
I
suspect
that
they
have
no
expertise
approaching
wildlife
Their
boats
are
huge
and
loud
They
should
not
be
anywhere
near
the
seals
or
other
wildlife
Gothamist
please
send
someone
out
on
one
of
these
tours
to
see
how
they
operate
before
pushing
their
services
I
fear
that
you
may
be
supporting
a
business
that
has
no
business
doing
what
they
are
doing

Is
this

It
seems
like
a
bad
idea
to
disturb
the
fledgling
wildlife
population
with
tourist
boats
There
should
be
a
law
against
approaching
wildlife
with
a
vehicle
boat
for
tour
purposes
If
we
want
a
healthy
wildlife
population
we
need
to

Greg

Returns
To

New

Thanks
Social

Supporters
After
successfully
fending
off
a
heavy
rape
allegation
life
is
back
to
normal
for
Good
Day
New
York
co
host
Greg
Kelly
son
of
NYPD
Commissioner
Ray
Kelly
The
43
year
old
former
Marine
told
reporters
he
felt
terrific
as
he
returned
to
the
Fox
New
York
office
on
East
67th
Street
this
morning
and
he
was
welcomed
back
warmly
by
his
co
host
Rosanna
Scotto
So
you
re
back
Scotto
observed
turning
to
Kelly
who
made
a
short
statement
at
the
start
of
the
broadcast
that
left
out
any
specifics
about
his
absence
Here
s
video
Rosanna
it
s
great
to
see
you
Kelly
said
on
air
Folks
thank
you
It
was
a
tough
couple
of
weeks
obviously
for
a
lot
of
people
And
I
m
very
very
grateful
for
all
the
support
I
had
here
at
Fox
Five
the
support
from
my
family
and
friends
those
I
care
about
and
the
viewers
of
course
They
ve
been
just
great
the
people
who
watch
the
show
and
have
weighed
in
through
social
media
positive
remarks
Thank
you
very
much
The
speech
concluded
with
a
smattering
of
applause
from
the
newsroom
And
I
m
especially
grateful
to
this
woman
sitting
next
to
me
Rosanna
Scotto
Kelly
added
Scotto
then
told
Kelly
they
were
going
right
back
to
where
we
left
off
to
which
Kelly
replied
I
don
t
know
about
that
I
don
t
want
to
work
too
hard
Today
s
Friday
And
speaking
of
social
media
Twitter
user

wrote
Greg
Kelly
proves
if
an

woman
is
lyin
ur
the
semi
famous
white
son
of
the
Police
Commissioner
it
will
all
be
resolved
very
quickly
Kelly
also
issued
a
statement
last
night
saying
I
am
thankful
that
the
investigation
established
what
I
ve
known
all
along
that
I
am
innocent
of
the
allegations
that
were
waged
against
me
I
am
so
blessed
to
have
a
wonderful
family
and
friends
whose
support
for
me
never
wavered
Ray
Kelly
has
not
commented
publicly
on
the
allegation
but
Mayor
Bloomberg
told
reporters
earlier
this
week
that
DA
Cy
Vance
did
exactly
what
he
should
do
He
right
away
called
his
best
sex
crime
investigators
put
it
on
the
case
They
concluded
apparently
according
to
the
paper
where
Bloomberg
read
the
news
that
there
was
no
law
broken
no
reason
to
bring
charges
on
either
side
and
dismissed
the
thing

let
s
get
back

that

There
is
no
proof
that
it
she
was
pregnant
and
if
she
was
there
is
no
proof
that
it
was
Kelly
who
impregnated
her
She
showed
poor
judgement
from
the
start
and
showed
that
she
is
irresponsible
and
reckless
First
to
cheat
on
her
boyfriend
then
to
have
unprotected
sex
and
finally
to
have
sex
in
her
boss
s
office
All
the
actions
of
someone
who
doesn
t
respect
any
boundaries
of
normal
behavior
If
she
was
capable
of
all
of
this
then
what
else
is
she
capable
of
I
never
thought
much
of
Greg
Kelly
before
this
actually
thought
he
was
a
bit
of
a
buffoon
But
he
handled
this
situation
with
a
lot
of
grace
and
character
and
I
respect
that
I
have
to
say
that
I
actually
like
him
now
and
will
likely
pay
more
attention
to
his
career
Hopefully
Kelly
learned
something
going
through
this
and
is
more
careful
moving
forward
letting
people
get
to
him
like
this
It
s
a
shame
the
DA
didn
t
press
charges
against
her
her
actions
were
beyond
criminal
The
bottom
line
is
that
no
man
should
have
to
have
his
named
dragged
through
the
mud
because
of
some
lying
cheating

replied
I
don

I
don

want
to

too
hard
Today
s
Rapeday
Edwin
Amirsaleh
Dude
the
guy
clearly
didn
t
do
it
What
are
you
talking
about
Read
the
facts
of
the
case
She
was
drunk
and
cheated
and
tried
to
double
back
on
it
TCF16
Wrong
She
couldn
t
remember
the
sex
act
The
police
found
her
story
to
remain
consistent
and
they
did
not
think
she
was
lying
It
is
not
clear
at
all
that
he
didn
t
do
it
The
only
thing
clear
is
that
there
wasn
t
enough
evidence
One
of
three
things
happened
1
She
was
blackout
drunk
NOT
unconcious
but
in
a
state
where
she
is
not
herslef
at
all
and
will
not
remember
anything
that
happened
the
next
day
Several
of
my
friends
are
like
this
and
it
s
scary
they
seem
concious
they
re
not
slurring
their
words
or
stumbling
but
they
are
beyond
drunk
and
the
next
day
they
have
zero
recollection
of
conversations
and
events
that
took
place
If
they
had
sex
in
this
state
it
s
probably
not
rape
since
she
consented
but
you
have
to
be
pretyy
drunk
yourself
or
a
real
weirdo
creep
to
go
through
it
if
you
re
the
guy
Of
course
they
did
JUST
MEET
so
maybe
he
didn
t
even
notice
2
She
passed
out
and
he
had
sex
with
her
Obviously
this
is
rape
but
if
she
didn
t
remember
what
happened
i
e
she
didn
t
even
remember
passing
out
and
he
didn
t
admit
it
you
can
t
bring
charges
3
She
consented
she
remembered
it
she
got
busted
for
cheating
and
tried
to
deflect
it
by
bringing
charges
whiteiris
She
was
blackout
drunk
NOT
unconcious
Wrong
The
bar
tab
was
so
low
it
was
determined
she
only
had
a
few
drinks
Also
surveillance
showed
her
walking
not
staggering
drunk
through
her
office
building
Finally
what
about
the
steamy
sex
messages
back
and
forth
between
them
both
All
it
proves
to
me
is
she
s
a
good
liar
Amber
This
is
out
of
every
argument
that
s
been
used
in
this
case
by
far
the
most
ridiculous
You
have
no
idea
how
high
this
woman
s
tolerance
for
alcohol
is
I
ve
seen
women
get
totally
smashed
off
two
beers
You
have
no
idea
if
she
had
a
few
drinks
before
she
got
to
the
bar
You
have
no
idea
if
other
patrons
at
the
bar
bought
Greg
Kelly
and
his
date
some
drinks
A
bar
tab
is
seriously
the
most
insubstantial
piece
of
evidence
and
you
are
an
idiot
for
thinking
a
low
bar
tab
proves
anything
Also
for
the
last
fucking
time
these
steamy
sex
messages
are
only
evidenced
by
a
tabloid
s
anonymous
sources
That
s
it
that
s
all
Yes
we
know
they
exchanged
texts
but
the
Post
s
anonymous
sources
are
the
only
ones
releasing
the
content
You
might
as
well
tell
me
you
take
everything
the
National
Enquirer
says
at
face
value
too
TCF16
First
of
all
she
could
have
been
drunk
when
she
showed
up
at
the
bar
or
the
bartender
or
another
patron
could
have
bought
them
shots
Second
and
here
is
where
my
public
service
annoiuncment
comes
in
I
ve
seen
people
get
blackout
drunk
after
two
drinks
It
s
really
really
weird
They
can
walk
straight
and
they
re
not
slurring
but
you
can
tell
something
is
completely
off
Sometimes
they
act
or
speak
really
irrationally
You
think
you
re
having
a
conversation
with
a
sober
person
but
they
don
t
make
any
sense
It
s
pretty
scary
actually
I
ve
seen
the
same
thing
with
people
who
do
get
obviously
drunk
slurring
stumbling
etc
where
the
next
day
they
have
no
idea
what
happened
for
the
last
few
hours
of
the
night
But
the
kind
where
they
seem
sober
but
are
really
totally
wasted
is
weird
Also
we
haven
t
seen
the
texts
so
we
really
don
t
know
what
they
say
GalBklyn
The
DA
did
not
conclude
that
no
law
was
broken
nor
that
Greg
Kelly
was
innocent
Just
that
there
was
not
enough
evidence
to
prosecute
Nice
spin
for
your
guy
Bloomberg
Peanut
Butter
The
DA
had
not
enough
if
any
evidence
to
bring
charges
which
is
the
lowest
bar
to
surpass
and
step
one
in
prosecuting
someone
Getting
a
grand
jury
indictment
is
the
next
higher
bar
then
proving
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
even
higher
Kelly
is
presumed
innocent
from
the
outset
Even
if
he
were
brought
to
trial
and
found
not
guilty
you
d
have
to
give
him
the
presumption
of
innocence
Not
to
mention
that
in
this
case
not
only
was
he
not
brought
to
trial
nor
a
grand
jury
indictment
not
handed
down
nor
sought
but
the
DA
didn
t
even
bring
any
charges
Linda
Fairstein
a
former
sex
crimes
prosecutor
and
expert
said
independently
that
she
had
not
seen
or
heard
anyone
establish
the
elements
of
a
sex
crime
having
been
committed
Does
that
information
help
you
to
reassess
your
position
GalBklyn
Not
the
way
this
case
was
handled
Especially
with
the
former
prosecuter
Farstein
chiming
in
when
the
investigation
was
ongoing
Completely
innappropriate
Fix
was
in
from
the
start
The
DA
has
no
credibility
Too
many
leaks
and
opinions
on
page
6
before
the
outcome
was
finalized
Greg
Kelly
may
think
he
is
in
the
clear
But
there
are
too
many
people
who
see
this
as
business
as
usual
The
combination
of
the
son
of
the
NYPD
Commissioner
a
white
man
with
an
apparent
sense
of
entitlement
and
a
sham
investigation
is
not
something
to
be
proud
of
whiteiris
Nice
spin
yourself
He
s
innocent
Throw
her
ass
in
jail
More
women
should
be
pissed
at
this
lying
accuser
for
making
it
harder
for
true
rape
victims
to
come
forward
felixthecat
it
will
be
harder
for
woman
to
come
forward
because
of
people
like
you
and
the
New
YORK
POST
who
vilified
her
even
before
the
investigation
with
those
new
leaks
SHAME
ON
Cy
Vance
what
a
tool
a
political
tool
as
well
Same
as
the
NYPD
release
the
kid
s
police
record
after
they
shot
him
Same
play
book
Peanut
Butter
You
can
t
leak
what
ain
t
there
It
s
a
shame
that
you
can
t
see
through
the
superficial
veneer
of
the
leaks
if
any
to
the
inconvenient
fact
that
there
was
information
not
favorable
to
the
allegations
to
leak
in
the
first
place
felixthecat
NO
one
is
free
of
sin
Treat
all
people
equally
a
bad
kid
doesn
t
deserve
to
be
executed
by
NYPD
nor
does
a
foolish
woman
deserve
to
be
raped
by
a
news
anchor
This
attack
on
victims
is
wrong
So
we
only
care
about
victims
that
have
NO
blemish
in
their
lives

New

City
tells
CBS
880
It
s
positive
news
for
the
industry
and
I
think
the
benefits
of
nuclear
power
are
clear
It
certainly
makes
his
job
easier
for
a
day
or
two
since
the
last
time
Indian
Point
was
in
the
news
the
Nuclear
Regulatory
Commission
was
rejecting
some
of
the
power
plant
s
fire
safety
procedures
Governor
Cuomo
has
said
that
Indian
Point
should
close
and
the
facility
has
been
under
increased
scrutiny
ever
since
an
earthquake
in
Japan
damaged
the
Fukishima
nuclear
reactor
Indian
Point
sits
at
the
intersection
of
two
fault
lines
and
has
been
branded
the
most
vulnerable
to
an
earthquake
in
the
nation
As
for
the
Georgia
plant
it
goes
without
saying
that
not
everyone
is
as
sanguine
as
Indian
Point
s
spokesman
Laura
Haight
at
the
New
York
Public
Interest
Research
Group
maintains
that
private
financing
is
almost
dead
in
the
water
for
nuclear
power
plants
It
s
too
risky
It
s
too
expensive
And
Allison
Fisher
an
energy
expert
for
the
consumer
advocacy
group
Public
Citizen
called
the
Georgia
plant
a
step
in
the
wrong
direction
It
is
inexplicable
that
we
ve
chosen
this
moment
in
history
to
expand
the
use
of
a
failed
and
dangerous
technology
Fisher
told
the
Washington
Post
Oh

Nuclear

has
changed
since
the
Gen
1
and
2
reactors

are

I

Indian

of
its
proximity

If

why
not

The
Crazy
Scene
At
Yesterday
s
School
Closings
Meeting
The
annual
fight
over
school
closures
between
the
city
parents
teachers
and
now
Occupiers
returned
in
full
force
last
night
for
a
raucous
crazy
meeting
at
Brooklyn
Tech
More
than
2
000
people
showed
up
for
an
evening
the
Times
describes
as
being
like
several
meetings
were
going
on
at
once
all
of
them
confused
and
cacophonous
with
sound
spilling
over
from
one
group
to
the
next
In
the
end
the
Panel
for
Education
Policy
voted
to
close
or
partially
close
the
23
schools
they
announced
in
December
And
even
without
Cathie
Black
to
kick
around
like
last
year
the
meeting
wasn
t
the
most
orderly
There
are
important
proposals
up

current
Schools
Commissioner
Walcott
said
If
all
the
teachers
union
wants
to
do
is
bus
in
Occupy
Wall
Street
protesters
then
we
will
just
have
to
work
around
that
And
so
they
did
Because
in
addition
to
the
Teachers
Union
which
had
originally
planned
to
hold
a
meeting
in
a
nearby
school
a
group
calling
themselves
Occupy
the
Department
of
Education
were
also
on
hand
to
help
foster
an
atmosphere
that
was
more
chaotic
than
usual
There
was
a
heavy
police
presence
but
the
NYPD
press
office
tells
us
there
weren
t
any
arrests
In
the
end
PEP
which
consists
of
Walcott
and
13
members
appointed
by
the
mayor
and
borough
presidents
voted
to
close
all
the
schools
on
the
block
as
it
has
done
every
time
it
has
convened
And
this
was
only
the
beginning
The
City
is
aiming
to
close
62
schools
this
year
as
part
of
Mayor
Bloomberg
s
educational
reform
plans
Amid
the
chanting
parents
teachers
and
students
spoke
to
the
Panel
in
the
hopes
of
saving
their
schools
I
m
angry
and
I
m
frustrated
I
am
afraid
for
the
future
of
my
child
s
life
one
mother
at
the
hearing
said
Although
the
panel
voted
to
close
the
schools
many
of
them
will
remain
open
for
a
few
more
years
as
they
graduate
their
current
classes
and
are
replaced
by
smaller
schools
Since
Bloomberg
became
mayor
the
city
has
opened
396
schools
and
closed
117
with
some
overlap
Despite
the
crazy
crowds
last
night
s
hearing
actually
broke
tradition
and
didn
t
actually
go
on
for
very
long
After
about
two
hours
the
2
500
seat
auditorium
began
to
empty
out
as
the
Occupy
members
reacted
to
an
unconfirmed
report
that
the
police
were
about
to
make
arrests
and
parents
and
students
gave
up
on
trying
to
speak

I
know
a
handful
of
NYC
teachers
and
they
are
borderline
retarded
Yet
they
get
paid
80K
per
year
because
salary
isn
t
based
on
skill
it
is
based
on
longevity
which
is
why
the
unions
exist
HarrietNYC
Hey
gothamist
did
it
not
occur
to
you
that
some
folks
associated
with
OccupyWallStreet
are
parents
of
NYC
public
school
students
and
some
may
be
NYC
teachers
They
are
not
mutually
exclusive
Do
you
think
the
teacher
s
union
had
to
bus
occupiers
in
That
was
just
b
s
coming
from
Walcott
Stevennnn
I
don
t
get
it
Are
the
schools
failing
for
a
lack
of
resources
and
bad
teachers
or
because
most
students
in
the
school
don
t
care
to
learn
Peanut
Butter
Any
time
a
school
s
in
trouble
or
underperforming
it
s
probably
the
students
and
in
turn
is
caused
by
their
parenting
HarrietNYC
ha
ha
guess
you
attended
one
of
the
failing
schools
Not
to
be
the
grammar
police
but
1
it
should
be
any
time
a
school
is
in
trouble
and
2
their
parenting
is
correct
you
should
learn
to
diagram
sentences
it
s
really
helpful
As
yourself
whose
parenting
your
sentence
infers
the
students
are
parenting
themselves
which
I
guess
is
a
bit
like
self
deportation
or
something
Oh
you
re
missing
a
comma
sgod
I
don
t
have
any
stake
in
this
discussion
and
I
usually
don
t
correct
people
s
grammar
on
the
internet
but
I
can
t
resist
Your
disastrous
post
is
much
worse
than
Peanut
Butter
s
You
forget
to
capitalize
the
first
letters
of
a
couple
of
your
sentences
You
misuse
infer
the
word
you
mean
is
imply
You
have
two
comma
splices
in
the
sentence
ending
it
s
really
helpful
You
use
a
comma
in
place
of
a
period
after
self
deportation
or
something
And
you
are
wrong
that
school
s
should
be
replaced
with
school
is
the
apostrophe
here
signals
a
contraction
not
a
possessive
Peanut
Butter
Seriously
I
didn
t
know
whether
to
respond
earnestly
or
laugh
The
infer
imply
error
drives
me
up
the
freakin
wall
At
best
Harriet
got
me
on
the
parenting
which
at
worst
is
ambiguous
as
it
could
mean
the
students
were
self
parenting
but
as
any
rational
person
could
reason
in
that
context
meant
the
students
received
poor
parenting

on
books
that

And
most
of
the
new

will
be
free
for
just
a
day
or
two
at
a
time
so
we
are
working
hard
to
make

that
you
do
not
miss
the
ones
you
want
Here
are
some
books
that
have
just

who
have
already
proven
to
be
favorites
with

Please
grab
them
now
if
they
look
interesting
to
you
because
they
probably
won

for
long

Refusal
To
Provide
Tax

to

is
Crippling

TIGA
The
Independent
Game
Developers
Association
has
been
fighting
with
the
UK
government
over
tax
breaks
for
the
gaming
industry
According
to
the
New
York
Times
Because
video
game
makers
straddle
the
lines
between
software
development
the
entertainment
industry
and
online
retailing
they
can
combine
tax
breaks
in
ways
that
companies
like
Netflix
and
Adobe
cannot
But
this
isn
t
the
case
in
the
UK
meaning
that
many
UK
developers
are
emigrating
heading
to
countries
which
provide
those
types
of
incentives
Rocksteady
designer
Sefton
Hill
has
described
this
as
a
talent
drain
for
the
UK
gaming
industry
In
an
interview
with
CVG
Hill
was
asked
whether
or
not
he
thought
the
UK
could
be
competitive
with
countries
like
the
US
with
regard
to
gaming
Hill
responds
that
many
of
his
friends
have
gone
abroad
to
find
work
Places
like
Montreal
are
hot
spots
for
development
because
they
have
incredible
tax
breaks

I
concede
that
some
video
games
or
even
entire
video
game
genres
are
simply
too
complex
or
difficult
for
certain
players
to
appreciate
Or
perhaps
some
individuals
simply
dislike
lengthy
complicated
experiences
In
some
regards
I
have
to
admit
that
games
can
be
major
investment
and
if
someone
is
unwilling
to
dip
past
the
surface
mechanics
of
a
video
game
then
they
are
entitled
to
their
reservations
In
that
sense
I
can
rationalize
the
existence
of
a
game
like
King
Arthur
II
despite
my
dislike
for
games
of
its
philosophy
King
Arthur
II
is
obviously
the
sequel
to
King
Arthur
The
Roleplaying
Wargame
a
game
unique
in
that
it
ties
together
multiple
genres
into
a
fairly
well
executed
package
King
Arthur
II
adopts
much
of
its
predecessor
s
gameplay
but
also
expands
upon
it
slightly
Still
this
is
clearly
not
as
profound
a
package
as
a
Total
War
game
and
it
shows
through
the
game
s
presentation
and
gameplay

left
Sony
However
1UP
has
thrown
us
a
bone
to
chew
on
while
we
wait
for
the
real
prize
as
they
interviewed
Sony
Worldwide
Studios
president
Shuhei
Yoshida
about
the
Last
Guardian
First
Yoshida
wanted
to
stress
that
Ueda
didn
t
leave
Sony
He
isn
t
an
employee
but
he
is
continuing
to
work
on
the
Last
Guardian
as
a
contractor
without
any
real
changes
to
his
presence
on
the
team
He
still
goes
into

As
far
as
rumors
go
the
suggestion
that
the
new
Xbox
console
will
have
a
built
in
touchscreen
like
the
Wii
U
is
one
of
the
least
substantiated
but
we
re
hearing
it
again
Last
month
GameSpot
was
discussing
the
likelihood
of
the
controller
prototype
and
now
Xbox
World
magazine
is
reporting
from
their
sources
that
this
decision
is
more
than
just
conjecture
The
report
in
XBW
suggests
that
the
controller
design
is
hoping
to
look
more
akin
to
a
handheld
like
the
PS
Vita
rather
than
a
sizable
tablet
controller
like
the
Wii
U
The
report
describes
the
design
as
an
HD
screen
surrounded
by
the
traditional
360
buttons
and
sticks

If
your
significant
other
was
bitten
by
a
zombie
what
would
you
do
Would
you
kill
them
and
put
them
out
of
their
misery
Or
would
you
cut
off
their
head
and
use
nonexistent
technology
to
keep
it
alive
Personally
I
would
go
with
number
two
but
that
s
just
me
Needless
to
say
that
is
the
route
that
Juliet
takes
in
the
new
trailer
for
Suda
51
s
upcoming
acid
trip
Lollipop
Chainsaw
This
trailer
introduces
the
severed
head
that
had
been
hooked
to
Juliet
s
rear
in
the
previous
trailer
Apparently
he
used
have
a
super
hot
bod
before
getting
bit
by
a
zombie
Afterwards
in
a
truly
tear
jerking
act
of
love
Juliet
decapitates
him
Along
with
the
gleeful
shots
of
Juliet
s
rear
the
trailer
also
introduces
a
few
gameplay
elements
You
ll
be
able
to
use
Nick
s
head
as
a
weapon
as
well
as
attach
him
to
other
bodies
in
order
to
gain
jump
boosts
and
up
skirt
shots

The
Splatters
by
SpikySnail
Games
is
as
charming
and
unique
as
it
is
difficult
to
describe
It
s
basically
a
physics
driven
puzzler
where
the
goal
is
to
fling
sentient
balls
of
paint
around
in
an
effort
to
drench
and
detonate
bomb
clusters
After
an
initial
hands
on
with
the
game
at
PAX
last
year
the
development
team
pretty
much
went
dark
not
releasing
any
new
info
or
footage
of
the
game
until
now
The
latest
dev
diary
Flipping
Out
details
the
game
s
flip
mechanic
a
sort
of
time
reversal
maneuver
that
allows
your
Splatter
to
fly
back
in
the
direction
from
whence
it
came
Careful
timing
is
the
key
to
using
the
flip
successfully
and
looks
to
add
yet
another
layer
of
nuance
to
an
already
heavily
nuanced
game
The
Splatters
is
heading
for
a
tentative
Spring
release
but
in
the
meantime

Frictional

New

Frictional
Games
the
masters
of
indie
gaming
horror
have
dropped
a
hint
about
their
next
game
supposedly
a
follow
up
to
their
2010
hit
Amnesia
The
Dark
Descent
The
teaser
site
is
nothing
more
than
an
image
that
says
something
is
emerging
but
clicking
on
the
image
takes
you
to
a
Google
Maps
view
of
China
A
horror
title
set
in
possibly
ancient
China
Sign
me
up
Craig
Pearson
over
at
Rock
Paper
Shotgun
did
some
digging
and
proved
the
site
is
indeed
real
and
not
the
work
of
a
troll
trying
to
get
people
s
hopes
up
What
Frictional
has
up
its
sleeves
is
anyone
s
guess
at
this
point
but
if
the
first
Amnesia
title
was
any
indication
the
next
game
will
certainly
have
gamers
screaming
in
terror
as
Cthulhian
tentacle
monsters
chase
them
through
dark
hallways

Today
is
the
deadline
for
your
biggest
campaign
pitch
all
year
and
Murphy
s
Law
is
in
full
effect
You
need
campaign
documents
you
ve
forgotten
on
your
home
desktop
a
projector
that
can
display
at
246
inches
with
a
2200
1
contrast
ratio
and
a
GPS
that
will
inform
you
of
the
derailed
train
blocking
the
closest
highway
This
is
your
life
and
without
the
right
gadgets
and
electronics
to
make
it
through
things
like
train
wrecks
go
from
blocking
highways
to
being
how
you
describe
your
very
existence
These
days
though
the
toughest
part
of
getting
the
right
gear
is
finding
it
amidst
all
the
clutter
and
clamor
Half
of
your
search
results
aren
t
at
the
top
of
the
list
because
they
re
the
best
product
for
you
that
s
for
sure
There
are
seedy
armies
of
desk
jockeys
cramming
SEO
into
everything
they
write
Half
of
the
reviews
you
ll
find
by
very
very
serious
bloggers
are
five
star
ratings
because
they
got
buttered
up
by
a
P
R
rep
and
their
latest
plasma
TV
was
free
You
d
think
you
could
trust
Amazon
but
they
re
literally
putting
products
in
order
by
what
makes
them
the
most
money
not
by
what
is
most
relevant
to
your
search
eReaders
are
a
perfect
example
Naturally
Amazon
suggests
the
Kindle
It
s
perfect
for
everyone
Barnes
and
Noble
will
only
tell
you
about
the
Nook
It
s
perfect
for
everyone
Apple
is
caught
up
with
all
things
iPad
It
s
perfect
for
everyone
They
can
t
all
be
perfect
for
you
right
Clearly
one
is
more
suited
to
your
desires
but
how
do
you
know
if
you
re
a
Kinde
or
iPad
person
This
doesn
t
even
include
the
hundred
other
options
that
are
overshadowed
by
all
the
marketing
You
might
never
even
know
their
features
That
s
where
Pikimal
enters
the
fray
We
re
the
Master
Blaster
to
your
Thunderdome
Pikimal
allows
you
to
define
the
features
and
specs
that
you
want
need
in
a
sexy
new
device
Interested
in
the
biggest
television
you
can
get
for
the
lowest
price
Who
isn
t
What
about
the
biggest
television
with
3
HDMI
connections
that
also
streams
web
content
and
is
light
enough
for
your
grandmother
to
carry
We
can
give
you
those
results
that
detailed
as
quickly
as
you
can
drag
a
simple
slider
from
left
to
right
It
s
not
as
quick
as
snapping
your
fingers
or
clicking
your
heels
but
it
s
probably
as
close
as
you
re
going
to
get
Nothing
comes
between
you
and
the
products
that
best
match
your
interests
and
there
are
no
marketing
middlemen
deciding
what
sits
at
the
top
of
the
list
So
where
exactly
does
Piki
Geek
fit
in
all
this
With
knowledge
of
the
Pikimal
tool
and
the
Pikis
for
all
sorts
of
electronics
we
re
the
guys
with
a
healthy
or
possibly
unhealthy
passion
for
technology
and
gadgetry
From
which
tablet
PC
can
best
display
Porntube
to
which
eReader
has
the
finest
selection
of
classic
literature
graphic
novels
this
is
where
you
ll
find
the
information
we
ve
pulled
from
Pikimal
on
the
best
products
and
who
should
be
stoked
about
them
news
on
upcoming
tech
and
an
extra
double
shot
of
ridiculously
caffeinated
geeky
passion
to
wash
it
all
down
Let
s
be
clear
we
re
not
another
set
of
guys
reviewing
the
free
Xbox
360s
that
Microsoft
gives
out
at
press
conferences
We
re
pulling
from
the
hard
unchangeable
facts
and
product
specs
collected
by
the
coding
geniuses
Pikimal
which
cut
through
the
hype
and
other
marketing
techniques
that
can
cloud
your
judgment
There
s
nothing
old
school
about
the
latest
generation
of
electronics
so
why
are
we
still
searching
for
and
buying
products
like
it
s
1998
Let
s
recap
Reviews
are
biased
Sorry
Ebert
Google
s
been
ransacked
by
SEO
E
tailers
are
pushing
their
own
products
or
what
makes
them
the
most
cash
The
savvy
consumer
is
out
there
wading
through
all
the
online
muck
and
then
visiting
stores
to
get
hands
on
time
with
products
and
before
long
purchasing
a
digital
camera
has
taken
a
solid
month
Pikimal
is
the
new
school
and
it
s
in
a
class
of
its
own
We
re
streamlining
your
shopping
decisions
by
hitting
you
with
the
facts
and
none
of
the
spiel
Officially
the
game
is
changed
Feel
free
to
text
your
friends
and
let
them
know
or
follow
us
on
Twitter
for
quality
tech
obsessed
conversation
We
ve
got
geeks
behind
the
scenes
and
we
ll
be
putting
you
in
touch
with
the
robot
alarm
clock
you
ve
always
wanted
the
speakers
that
will
rattle
your
nose
hairs
and
the
rest
of
your
geek
passions
on
a
silver
motherboard
platter
Mostly
we
ll
keep
your
eyes
affixed
to
the
electronics
you
re
looking
for
and
the
train
that
is
your
life
will
happily
remain
on
its
tracks

Considering

I
have

a

Before
we
plunge
headlong
into
the
depths
of
tech
specs
and
unyielding
geek
passion
we
thought
it
best
to
introduce
our
siblings
to
anyone
who
might
find
that
their
interests
while
surely
geeky
also
veer
into
some
other
captivating
specialties
Pikimal
is
currently
the
mother
father
figure
to
three
blogs
of
which
we
are
proudly
one
Outside
of
Piki
Geek
we
re
happy
to
announce
that
Piki
Eat
has
recently
launched
and
Piki
Parenting
is
gearing
up
to
bring
baby
mommas
all
the
child
rearing
and
product
knowledge
they
could
possibly
need
We
re
proud
to
be
in
the
company
of
experts
like
Daniel
Stuchel
the
Foodie
Prime
behind
Piki
Eat
and
Kari
DePhillips
the
Piki
Parenting
Master
of
Mom
hood
We
ve
collected
experts
like
these
inundated
them
with
the
Piki
interface
and
then
set
them
free
to
engage
their
passions
via
their
blogs
You
know
just
like
we
do
for
the
denizens
of
the
geek
world
With
these
three
blogs
in
tow
Pikimal
is
starting
up
by
helping
you
make
the
best
decisions
of
your
life
What
food
you
put
in
your
mouth
where
your
baby
sleeps
and
whether
or
not
you
need
a
surround
sound
receiver
with
9

support
and
1080p

upconversion

It
s
the
weekend
before
Valentine
s
Day
which
means
all
the
good
restaurants
and
movies
are
going
to
be
swamped
with
goobers
celebrating
their
big
dumb
relationships
If
you
re
looking
for
a
cheap
date
Catherine
is
looking
for
a
little
company
and
we
must
say
she
s
looking
mighty
fine
at
a
discount
The
PSN
is
also
happy
to
dump
a
heaping
helping
of
nostalgia
in
your
lap
with
an
old
arcade
game
and
a
few
PS2
classics
Along
with
a
number
of
other
great
games
this
week
also
marks
the
arrival
of

The

Jak

combines
classic
platforming
with
goofy
humor
and
lovable
characters
while
its
successors
throw
in
a
GTA

to

things
up

Remember
the
good
old
days
of
hunting
down
every

quarter
to
blow
on
the
machines
next
door
Arcades
might
be
a
thing
of
the
past
but
luckily
their
games
don
t
have
to

See
if
your
heart
can
handle
the
nostalgia
as
you
and
three
friends
chase
down
Mr
Burns
and
Smithers
in
an
attempt

save
Maggie

Legal
issues
are
pretty
common
in
this
industry
and
for
the
most
part
they
re
over
miniscule
things
In
this
case
that
thing
is
the
trademark
of
the
acronym
DOTA
Blizzard
recently
filed
a
complaint
against
Valve
in
an
attempt
to
gain
control
of
DOTA
and
all
related
names
DOTA
or
Defense
of
the
Anicents
began
as
a
mod
in
Blizzard
s
popular
RTS
Warcraft
3
Valve
became
interested
in
making
DOTA
2
after
corresponding
with
Icefrog
DOTA
s
original
developer
and
inviting
him
to
the
Valve
offices
Soon
after
they
filed
a
trademark
for
DOTA
so
that
they
could
begin
work
on
the
sequel
Meanwhile
Blizzard
is
in
the
midst
of
creating
a
Blizzard
DOTA
for
Starcraft
2
From
the
court
documents
DOTA
has
been
used
as
the
popular
name
of
a
Warcraft
III
software
mod
file
that
has
been
distributed
marketed
and
promoted
by
Blizzard
and
its
fans
under
license
from
Blizzard
that
utilizes
and
is
built
upon
the
Warcraft
III
game
engine
interface
and
gameplay
mechanics
that
is
comprised
of
Warcraft
III
characters
items
spells
artwork
textures
and
color
palates
that
can
be
played
only
using
Warcraft
III
software
and
via
Blizzard
s
online
service
Battle
net
and
whose
name
DOTA
an
acronym
for
Defense
of
the
Ancients
is
a
reference
to
Warcraft
III
characters
known
as
the
Ancients
Warcraft
III
s
EULA
clearly
specifies
that
all
underlying
intellectual
property
rights
in
and
to
Warcraft
III
are
owned
by
Blizzard
All
title
ownership
rights
and
intellectual
property
rights

What
does
everything
think
about
this
Do
you
think
Blizzard
has
valid
claims
for
the
ownership
of
the
title
Or
should
it
go
to
Valve
and
Icefrog

I
m
pretty
sure
Valve
laid
claim
to
the
Dota
2
name
by
using
it
as
an
acronym
stripped
of
the
acronymity
thus
making
it
a
legitimate
name
that
doesn
t
mean
anything
They
said
as
much

It
s
a

flimsy
but
it
s
a
valid
legal
defence
that
has
a
modicum
of
weight

Frictional
Games
the
masters
of
indie
gaming
horror
have
dropped
a
hint
about
their
next
game
supposedly
a
follow
up
to
their
2010
hit
Amnesia
The
Dark
Descent
The
teaser
site
is
nothing
more
than
an
image
that
says
something
is
emerging
but
clicking
on
the
image
takes
you
to
a
Google
Maps
view
of
China
A
horror
title
set
in
possibly
ancient
China
Sign
me
up
Craig
Pearson
over
at
Rock
Paper
Shotgun
did
some
digging
and
proved
the
site
is
indeed
real
and
not
the
work
of
a
troll
trying
to
get
people
s
hopes
up
What
Frictional
has
up
its
sleeves
is
anyone
s
guess
at
this
point
but
if
the
first
Amnesia
title
was
any
indication
the
next
game
will
certainly
have
gamers
screaming
in
terror
as
Cthulhian
tentacle
monsters
chase
them
through
dark
hallways

To
see
the
impact
color
has
on
the
overall
user
experience
of
a
website
one
need
only
strip
away
a
hue
to
see
how
the
visual
flow
is
affected
While
color
creates
the
mood
and
feel
of
the
site
by
directing
user
attention
to
certain
elements
there
are
many
ways
to
approach
the
use
of
color
Hue
value
and
saturation
are
all
three
integrated
dimensions
of
color
that
when
used
properly
can
enhance
the
site
s
message
just
as
well
if
not
better
than
using
flashy
colors
In
this
article
we
ll
delve
deeper
into
color
psychology
as
it
relates
to
web
design
and
view
examples
of
sites
that
used
color
persuasively
in
their
branding
efforts
A
quick
intro
to
color
For
a
primer
on
color
one
should
refer
to
the
color
wheel
as
it
presents
a
logically
arranged
sequence
of
pure
hues
I
m
sure
you
re
familiar
with
the
primaries
red
yellow
and
blue
and
secondaries
green
orange
and
purple
which
are
formed
by
mixing
the
primaries
Tertiary
colors
are
comprised
of
the
middle
colors
like
yellow
green
and
blue
green
They
are
created
by
mixing
a
primary
color
and
a
secondary
color
We
often
refer
to
the
color
wheel
as
it
can
be
used
to
create
harmonious
color
schemes
leading
to
an
effective
visual
experience
The
Power
of
Color
The
two
most
popular
advertising
color
choices
in
America
blue
and
red
are
frequently
used
on
websites
globally
Blue
connotes
trustworthiness
loyalty
and
sincerity
and
is
most
often
a
business
favorite
due
to
these
attributes
But
blue
isn
t
for
everyone
and
the
best
method
of
determining
the
right
color
or
colors
for
your
brand
or
website
is
to
first
consider
the
target
group
you
re
trying
to
reach
Colors
have
different
meanings
to
various
age
groups
cultures
and
nationalities
They
have
the
power
to
reach
beyond
just
connotations
and
hold
the
viewer
s
attention
communicate
what
the
business
is
about
and
make
a
sale
When
you
think
of
the
impact
color
has
on
a
particular
audience
it
s
easy
to
see
why
companies
exert
a
lot
of
time
and
effort
in
choosing
the
right
one
5
website
elements
affected
by
color
1
Text
Links
A
common
solution
for
drawing
attention
to
monochromatic
links
is
to
give
them
a
faint
background
to
lift
them
off
the
page
This
technique
is
shown
in
the
navigation
for
AppZapper
The
active
link
on
the
navigation
for
Font
Explorer
is
styled
differently
than
the
rest
giving
the
user
a
quick
glimpse
at
where
they
are
on
the
website
2
Navigation
Bronto
uses
saturated
colors
to
bring
attention
to
its
navigation
This
balance
works
well
with
the
rest
of
the
site
which
is
more
subdued
yet
takes
up
more
screen
real
estate
3
Buttons
Postbox
uses
red
and
blue
on
its
call
to
action
buttons
These
highly
saturated
and
large
buttons
do
a
great
job
of
drawing
attention
to
the
intended
action
the
user
should
take
to

or

Compare
how
the
less
saturated
button
just
below
and
to
the
right
would
fare
if
those
buttons
switched
colors
The
complimentary
color
of
blue
is
used
on
the

set
it

on

layout
and
add
emphasis

Headings
The

vibrant

for

List
Items
A
Small
Orange
makes
use
of
its
brand
colors
in
the
list
of
recent
news
posts
The
color
doesn
t
overwhelm
as
it
s
used
sparingly
with
a
white
background
to
ease
its
vibrancy
Color
can
affect
readability
If
the
text
on
your
site
is
meant
for
scanning
instead
of
reading
it
s
okay
to
have
gray
text
on
a
black
background
On
the
website
for
VersionsApp
the
monotony
is
broken
up
through
highlighting
and
the
use
of
splashes
of
color
throughout
the
text
Sometimes
the
best
solution
is
to
have
dark
text
on
a
white
background
Readability
is
hardly
a
problem
with
this
method
When
necessary
you
can
incorporate
color
into
quotes
or
bullet
points
as
shown
here
for
Crazy
Egg
Color
can
affect
accessibility
We
should
also
think
of
color
in
terms
of
accessibility
for
color
blind
users
After
all
these
color
deficiencies
affect
about
8
of
males
and
0
5
of
females
The
great
thing
about
designing
for
this
niche
is
good
design
judgment
is
really
all
it
takes
For
instance
don
t
use
colors
with
similar
brightness
values
as
the
base
of
your
website
This
causes
the
text
to
vibrate
and
can
lead
to
watery
eyes
Also
if
you
re
going
to
use
a
change
in
background
color
to
designate
a
hover
state
make
sure
it
has
enough
contrast
and
is
different
in
its
relative
brightness
It
s
also
a
good
idea
to
add
another
design
element
such
as
a
stroke
to
a
button
when
this
hover
is
activated
providing
further
contrast
The
call
to
action
buttons
on
the
website
for
Notify
feature
a
contrasting
outer
glow
stroke
when
the
user
hovers
over
them
Such
small
details
add
contrast
to
the
button
Going
Monochromatic
We
re
past
the
era
of
web
design
where
we
have
to
use
as
many
flashy
colors
as
possible
to
grab
the
user
s
attention
Thankfully
we
ve
developed
insight
into
how
we
can
convey
a
message
using
shades
of
one
color
The
use
of
monochromatic
color
in
layouts
is
a
common
practice
for
designers
who
want
to
portray
a
balanced
interface
while
focusing
on
the
overall
UX
instead
of
merely
coloring
things
up
As
you
ll
see
by
the
following
examples
it
s
possible
to
create
an
engaging
and
informed
layout
by
simply
using
one
color
The
Invoice
Machine
uses
a
grayscale
for
the
design
of
its
invoicing
software
s
website
Blue
the
common
color
for
links
is
used
as
a
border
around
the
buttons
emphasizing
their
importance
in
relation
to
the
rest
of
the
site
This
makes
the
buttons
stand
out
without
resulting
in
a
bubbly
3
D
look
Davroc
Interiors
creates
a
soothing
visual
experience
on
its
website
Hover
over
the
photographs
to
reveal
full
color
images
that
add
a
layer
of
interest
to
the
minimal
website
Blue
the
universal
link
color
is
used
in
areas
throughout
the
site
to
enhance
the
user
experience
Metelab
also
uses
a
monochromatic
color
scheme
on
its
website
Notice
the
use
of
saturation
on
the
top
right
button
Saturated
colors
are
effective
on
buttons
links
alerts
and
system
messages
because
they
grab
the
user
s
attention
It
s
important
to
use
these
colors
sparingly
as
too
many
can
slow
the
user
down
When
used
correctly
saturation
can
be
exciting
and
dynamic
Gray
is
a
common
color
used
in
web
design
these
days
because
it
doesn
t
compete
with
saturated
and
desaturated
colors
The
absence
of
color
on
The
Grid
System
site
is
a
great
opportunity
to
make
use
of
white
space
and
bold
typography
when
necessary
Such
elements
help
create
hierarchy
by
grouping
elements
together
according
to
importance
There
may
be
millions
of
colors
out
there
and
as
a
designer
my
goal
is
to
choose
those
that
speak
to
my
client
s
business
and
mission
While
some
companies
adopt
color
as
a
tool
to
enhance
dynamism
others
are
put
off
by
it
when
used
sporadically
Through
the
examples
I
ve
shown
in
this
article
I
hope
to
strike
a
balance
between
these
extremes
one
where
color
can
be
used
in
all
its
vibrancy
but
still
be
elegant
and
alternative
approaches
to
the
use
of
color
such
as
the
monochromatic
color
scheme
Have
you
noticed
a
color
trend
that
is
not
addressed
in
this
article

Stephanie
getting
the
right
combination
of
colours
is
very
important
as
you
have
highlighted
here
if
you
notice
in
all
of
them
the
key
is
to
keep
it
simple
Not
to
over
complicate
the
site
with
funky
colours
and
to
instead
focus
on
user
experience
and
conversions
Thanks
for

Why
do
you
do
what
you
do
One
of
the
ways
we
decide
what
to
do
is
to
find
out
what
others
are
doing
You
know
like
when
you
re
in
a
restaurant
and
you
don
t
know
what
to
order
It
s
easy
to
say
I
ll
have
what
he
s
having
It
s
called
social
proof
Social
proof
is
one
of
Dr
Robert
Cialdini
s
five
laws
of
influence
And
it
s
a
powerful
one
Dr
Cialdini
reminds
us
that
advertisers
incessantly
remind
us
that
their
products
are
the
best
selling
or
fastest
growing
to
imply
that
others
are
doing
it
so
why
aren
t
you
Bartenders
salt
their
tip
jar
with
a
10
bill
to
increase
tips
Sitcoms
provide
laugh
tracks
to
activate
our
deep
rooted
instincts
to
do
what
others
are
doing
in
this
case
laughing
On
the
web
customer
testimonials
have
proven
to
be
a
high
impact
method
for
increasing
web
conversions
But
all
testimonials
are
not
created
equal
Sure
putting
any
authentic
testimonial
on
your
website
is
likely
to
lift
conversions
But
if
you
apply
the
three
tips
below
testimonials
can
provide
a
tremendous
lift
in
web
conversions
Step
1
Gather
testimonials
that
overcome
sales
objections
Make
a
list
of
every
reason
a
prospect
would
not
purchase
your
product
or
service
Now
gather
at
least
one
testimonial
that
overcomes
each
objection
For
instance
Jane
sells
website
design
services
She
often
hears
from
customers
that
they
don
t
want
to
rebuild
their
website
because
they
aren
t
sure
if
they
will
ever
recover
the
cost
of
redesigning
A
testimonial
like
this
ought
to
do
the
trick
I
redesigned
my
website
with
Jane
and
recovered
my
money
the
first
six
months
of
having
my
new
website
Now
it
s
all
positive
ROI
It
was
the
best
investment
I
made
this
year
And
Jane
also
receives
sales
objections
from
prospects
who
think
redesigning
a
web
site
will
be
too
time
intensive
Gathering
a
testimonial
like
this
one
should
calm
their
nerves
Jane
s
website
design
process
was
so
simple
She
was
very
considerate
of
my
time
and
I
came
away
with
a
professional
new
website
with
none
of
the
hassle
Every
prospect
that
hasn
t
converted
is
held
up
by
some
objection
The
right
testimonial
will
provide
the
social
proof
needed
to
convert
the
prospect
Step
2
Place
testimonials
strategically
Sure
Jane
could
place
the
above
testimonials
on
the
home
page
Or
in
a
rotating
area
in
the
sidebar
header
or
footer
But
there
is
a
better
way
Great
marketers
and
sales
people
seem
to
know
just
the
right
time
to
say
something
They
can
anticipate
the
next
question
in
the
mind
of
the
prospect
The
difficulty
in
writing
good
sales
copy
is
anticipating
the
prospect
s
next
question
without
being
with
them
physically
Put
some
thought
into
the
placement
of
your
testimonials
If
you
do
you
ll
likely
find
a
strategic
area
to
place
each
testimonial
For
instance
on
the
sales
page
for
Jane
s
website
design
services
there
will
be
or
should
be
an
area
where
Jane
addresses
the
issue
of
price
Some
testing
would
be
in
order
but
for
those
without
the
time
or
the
volume
of
traffic
needed
to
test
it
would
make
sense
to
place
this
testimonial
next
to
your
discussion
about
pricing
In
general
don
t
just
place
testimonials
without
thinking
Take
a
minute
to
place
the
testimonial
in
a
location
where
it
has
the
best
chance
of
overcoming
the
objection
that
is
on
the
prospect
s
mind
Step
3
Add
meat
not
cheese
to
your
testimonials
Unfortunately
we
have
grown
skeptical
of
testimonials
Too
many
scammers
out
there
writing
testimonials
that
range
from
clearly
fake
to
slightly
cheesy
As
a
result
testimonials
have
to
have
meat
on
their
bones
Consider
adding
the
following
to
your
testimonials
to
boost
their
credibility
Head
shot
Full
name
Company
name
Title
Website
URL
Blood
type
Of
course
I
m
kidding
about
the
blood
type
but
the
point
is
that
testimonials
that
provide
more
detail
will
convert
better
They
re
simply
more
believable
For
instance
the
testimonial
written
for
Jane
s
website
design
services
will
be
much
more
credible
if
it
looked
like
this
Jane
s
website
design
process
was
so
simple
She
was
very
considerate
of
my
time
and
I
came
away
with
a
professional
new
website
with
none
of
the
hassle

How
to
effectively
gather
testimonials
First
don
t
be
afraid
to
ask
for
testimonials
A
happy
customer
is
usually
willing
to
provide
a
testimonial
for
you
After
all
you
solved
their
problem
Be
ready
to
pop
the
question
at
any
point
throughout
your
relationship
with
a
customer
The
best
time
to
ask
is
when
they
praise
you
Customers
will
often
say
things
like
Wow
Jane
You
really
saved
my
life
here
I
really
appreciate
you
being
so
responsive
on
this
problem
My
boss
was
breathing
down
my
neck
A
logical
follow
up
from
Jane
would
be
It
was
my
pleasure
I
have
really
enjoyed
working
on
this
project
Would
you
mind
providing
me
a
short
testimonial
for
my
marketing
materials
How
can
they
say
no
to
that
Some
customers
don
t
go
out
of
their
way
to
compliment
you
but
if
you
know
they
re
happy
with
your
services
ask
for
the
testimonial
Phrase
your
requests
for
testimonials
carefully
And
when
you
ask
the
way
you
phrase
the
question
is
critical
Remember
you
re
trying
to
address
objections
that
prospects
have
while
they
re
reading
the
sales
copy
on
your
website
For
example
if
Jane
knows
she
needs
a
testimonial
that
will
overcome
the
price
objection
on
her
website
she
could
phrase
the
request
for
testimonial
this
way
It
was
my
pleasure
I
have
really
enjoyed
working
on
this
project
Would
you
mind
providing
me
a
short
testimonial
for
my
marketing
materials
Perhaps
you
could
answer
this
question
Why
do
you
think
working
with
Jane
on
your
website
redesign
was
a
good
value
for
your
business
By
phrasing
the
request
for
testimonial
in
this
way
you
make
it
very
likely
that
the
customer
will
provide
you
with
the
testimonial
you
need
to
overcome
the
price
objection
Take
advantage
of
these
tips
and
provide
the
powerful
social
proof
needed
to
increases
conversions
It
s
true
All
testimonials
are
not
created
equally

matter
They
want
to
do
it
But
not
everyone
can
write
sales
letters
like
that
Unless
you
know
the
three
appeals
that
are
behind
every
successful
advertisement
The
good
sales
letters
use
at
least
one
of
these
appeals
The
best
use
all
three
What
are
these
three
appeals
Let
s
explore
Sex
Soft
core
Hard
core
No
core
Sex
sells
Men
s
Health
knows
this
and
makes
a
mint
from
creating
products
and
sales
letter
that
put
the
physical
act
and
how
to
get
better
at
more
of
it
as
a
key
motivator
for
sales
The
image
above
is
from
one
of
their
products
The
Big
Book
of
Sex
They
do
an
excellent
job
of
segmenting
their
audience
between
men
and
women
and
then
creating
appeals
that
well
appeal
to
each
But
using
sex
as
an
appeal
isn
t
limited
to
the
physical
act
Sex
includes
love
friendship
and
affection
This
is
what
I
mean
by
no
core
Love
Panky
is
appealing
to
women
who
not
only
want
to
fall
in
true
love
with
a
man
but
make
that
same
man
fall
in
love
with
them
What
makes
these
appeals
work
so
well
is
that
they
are
native
to
what
is
being
sold
Bad
uses
of
this
appeal
occur
when
you
try
to
pump
up
sales
with
woman
who
strip
while
you
talk
about
your
web
domain
service
Go
Daddy
anyone
Greed
It
s
in
our
bones
That
desire
to
live
like
the
rich
Jet
set
around
the
world
Own
boats
as
big
as
school
buses
Spill
more
sashimi
than
most
people
will
eat
in
a
lifetime
The
Rich
Jerk
successfully
milked
this
appeal
for
years
And
it
s
what
fuels
the
Motley
Fool
Greed
is
why
magazines
like
Money
and
Fortune
are
popular
While
these
magazines
are
straight
forward
about
their
goal
getting
rich
it
s
less
obvious
in
publications
like
Financial
Times
or
Forbes
But
it
s
still
there
If
you
can
show
someone
how
to
make
six
figures
a
year
retire
young
or
even
horde
hundreds
of
products
through
coupons
then
you
are
using
the
greed
appeal
correctly
Fear
Just
like
sex
sells
so
does
fear
It
could
be
a
test
crash
dummy
hitting
a
dash
board
at
60
miles
per
hour
A
group
of
teenagers
piling
up
body
bags
outside
of
the
headquarters
of
a
cigarette
manufacturer
Or
a
life
of
poverty
for
your
children
after
you
die
Fear
appeals
work
on
that
sense
of
uncertainty
we
have
This
is
why
insurance
and
services
like
tax
shelters
that
protect
your
money
from
the
hands
of
the
government
and
greedy
lawyers
are
so
effective
For
example
look
at
the
headline
below
from
Stansberry
Research
At
first
blush
it
might
not
seem
to
be
about
fear
but
notice
the
phrase
change
your
life
There
s
the
uncertainty
I
was
talking
about
It
s
combined
with
the
bad
news
of
the
U
S
debt
downgrade
to
make
an
intriguing
headline
that
could
prove
crucial
if
you
decide
to
ignore
Putting
It
All
Together
Using
just
one
of
these
appeals
in
your
sales
letter
will
get
you
some
good
response
Use
two
and
you
ll
get
even
better
All
three
that
s
a
sales
letter
orgasm
The
headline
Loud
Sex
Is
a
Billion
Dollar
Problem
from
Forbes
combines
fear
and
greed
and
sex
effectively
You
ve
got
the
sex
greed
Billion
Dollar
and
the
fear
Problem
This
wouldn
t
make
a
great
sales
letter
headline
however
You
know
why
It
s
not
clear
that
the
problem
impacts
the
reader
or
that
he
ll
personally
benefit
if
he
reads
the
copy
If
you
want
to
do
that
you
d
write
Why
the
Loud
Sex
Problem
Is
Costing
You
a
Billion
Dollars
Greed
is
behind
the
Publishing
Clearing
House
s
Sweepstakes
and
state
lottery
games
Illinois
took
it
a
step
further
and
hilariously
wove
fear
into
their
greed
appeal
Let
me
close
with
a
little
secret
out
of
all
of
the
above
appeals
greed
is
the
most
powerful
Meaning
if
you
can
appeal
to
people
s
greed
you
are
going
to
write
a
better
sales
letter
This
is
born
out
by
my
own
experience
and
it
s
born
out
by
copywriting
veterans
like
John
Caples
Then
again
if
you
can
write
a
sales
letter
appeal
combining
all
three
you
just
might
be
able
to
retire
young
in
a
radioactive
safe
bunker
with
Angelina
Jolie
Or
Brad
Pitt
Your
choice
Your
Turn
By
the
way
the
title
of
this
post
is
The
Sexiest
Way
to
Make
So
Much
Money
It
Scares
You
Got
any
idea
what
that
is
My
idea
was
simply
to
combine
all
three
appeals
together
in
a
sales
letter
but
I
was
wondering
if
anybody
could
come
up
with
a
real
occupation
or
gimmick
that
combines
all
three

For
a
lot
of
bloggers
self
hosting
with
Wordpress
org
provides
the
most
professional
blogging
platform
available
If
you
started
out
using
Blogger
and
now
need
a
professional
presence
there
s
a
good
chance
that
you
re
ready
to
switch
to
Wordpress
org
But
the
point
of
this
article
isn
t
to
convince
you
to
switch
If
you
re
trying
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
switch
there
are
better
articles
to
read
But
if
you
have
decided
to
switch
this
post
will
walk
you
through
step
by
step
how
to
quickly
and
easily
transfer
from
Blogger
to
Wordpress
org
Step
1
Sign
up
for
hosting
The
first
step
in
transferring
from
Blogger
to
Wordpress
org
is
to
sign
up
for
hosting
If
you
haven
t
picked
out
a
hosting
company
yet
Blue
Host
offers
low
prices
that
are
competitive
with
other
popular
Wordpress
hosts
and
they
re
also
reliable
To
top
it
off
they
provide
excellent
customer
service
and
they
re
control
panel
is
one
of
the
easiest
to
use
You
can
t
go
wrong
by
choosing
Blue
Host
Another
good
choice
is
Host
Gator
They
offer
some
of
the
best
rates
in
the
business
and
they
re
known
for
their
excellent
customer
service
Note
If
you
haven
t
already
purchased
a
domain
name
Blue
Host
also
offers
a
free
domain
name
when
you
set
up
your
account
Step
2
Install
Wordpress
on
your
hosting
account
After
signing
up
for
hosting
the
next
step
is
to
install
Wordpress
on
your
hosting
account
To
do
so
first
log
into
your
hosting
control
panel
Next
find
the
Wordpress
icon
located
underneath
a
heading
such
as
Simplescripts
Installation
or
Software
Services
The
wording
will
be
different
for
each
hosting
company
and
you
can
always
start
a
live
chat
with
customer
support
if
you
need
help
Once
you
find
the
icon
follow
the
steps
to
install
Wordpress
Note
If
possible
you
ll
want
to
install
Wordpress
as
a
temporary
installment
This
will
allow
you
to
set
up
the
site
on
a
temporary
site
so
you
aren
t
making
all
of
the
changes
live
while
your
readers
are
watching
Step
3
Import
to
Wordpress
The
next
step
is
to
import
posts
from
Blogger
to
Wordpress
To
do
so
log
into
your
temporary
wordpress
installment
by
going
to
http
yourtemporarydomain
com
wp
admin
After
logging
in
go
to
the
left
hand
sidebar
and
click
on
Tools
and
then
select
Import
Posts
On
the
next
page
where
you
ll
be
asked
which
type
of
posts
you
d
like
to
import
choose
the
option
titled
Blogger
You
ll
next
be
asked
if
you
d
like
to
install
an
importer
for
Blogger
The
answer
is
yes
so
click
the
red
button
to
install
the
importer
Then
click
to
activate
and
install
the
plugin
You
ll
now
click
to
authorize
Wordpress
to
access
your
Blogger
account
and
then
follow
the
steps
to
import
posts
from
Blogger
to
Wordpress
Step
4
Double
check
the
content
Now
that
the
posts
have
been
transferred
you
ll
need
to
double
check
that
all
of
the
posts
and
comments
transferred
correctly
You
can
do
this
by
comparing
the
number
of
posts
and
comments
in
Wordpress
to
the
number
of
posts
and
comments
in
Blogger
You
ll
have
at
least
one
extra
post
and
one
extra
page
in
Wordpress
due
to
the
fact
that
Wordpress
automatically
generates
a
welcome
post
and
sample
page
when
it
s
first
installed
You
ll
want
to
delete
each
of
these
posts
and
pages
Note
Sometimes
not
all
of
the
posts
or
comments
transfer
correctly
If
this
is
the
case
there
may
or
may
or
may
not
be
an
easy
way
to
get
all
of
the
posts
transferred
You
can
contact
Blogger
or
troubleshoot
by
searching
on
Google
if
these
posts
are
critical
for
your
blog
In
cases
like
this
it
s
often
easier
to
not
worry
about
the
lost
posts
and
move
on
Step
5
Choose
and
configure
a
theme
After
making
sure
the
content
transferred
correctly
and
is
ready
to
go
navigate
to
Appearance
in
the
right
hand
sidebar
of
the
Wordpress
dashboard
and
select
themes
Then
click
Install
Themes
at
the
top
of
the
page
and
follow
the
steps
to
install
a
new
Wordpress
theme
You
ll
want
to
pick
out
a
theme
that
you
like
and
configure
it
to
work
the
way
you
want
it
to
After
picking
the
right
theme
for
your
site
you
can
take
some
time
to
configure
it
to
look
the
way
you
want
it
to
by
installing
plugins
and
widgets
and
adding
pages
You
can
even
pay
a
designer
for
a
custom
theme
if
you
re
so
inclined
Step
6
Change
the
permalink
structure
in
Wordpress
The
next
step
is
to
change
the
permalink
structure
in
Wordpress
The
reason
you
have
to
do
this
is
that
Blogger
does
crazy
things
with
their
permalink
structure
In
order
to
minimize
the
number
of
broken
links
you
ll
need
to
change
the
permalink
structure
in
Wordpress
to
match
the
crazy
setup
in
Blogger
To
do
this
click
on
Settings
in
the
left
hand
sidebar
of
the
Wordpress
dashboard
and
then
click
permalinks
Now
click
the
radio
button
for
custom
structure
To
the
right
of
the
button
copy
and
paste
this
year
monthnum
postname
html
The
permalink
structure
in
Wordpress
will
now
match
the
structure
on
the
old
Blogger
site
This
will
cause
most
of
the
links
to
work
properly
and
minimize
the
number
of
broken
links
Note
This
will
minimize
the
number
of
broken
links
but
it
won
t
eliminate
them
entirely
This
is
due
to
the
fact
that
Blogger
removes
articles
such
as
a
an
and
the
from
urls
for
post
titles
and
Wordpress
does
not
Because
of
this
a
post
with
a
title
such
as
The
Absolute
Best
Way
to
Start
a
Wordpress
Blog
will
have
a
url
that
looks
like
www
yourdomain
com
absolute
best
way
start
wordpress
blog
in
Blogger
and
www
yourdomain
com
the
absolute
best
way
to
start
a
wordpress
blog
in
Wordpress
One
way
to
fix
this
is
to
go
through
and
manually
change
the
broken
urls
in
Wordpress
The
other
way
is
to
not
worry
about
it
If
there
s
a
third
and
better
way
and
you
know
what
that
is
make
sure
to
leave
a
comment
at
the
end
of
this
post
Step
7
Sign
up
for
and
configure
Feedburner
Now
that
you
re
using
Wordpress
you
ll
need
to
sign
up
for
Feedburner
in
order
to
manage
RSS
feeds
and
subscriptions
yourself
Start
by
going
to
Feedburner
and
signing
up
for
an
account
You
l
then
walk
through
the
steps
to
set
up
your
Feedburner
account
and
burn
a
feed
If
you
need
more
instructions
about
how
to
do
that
you
can
find
that
out
here
and
here
Step
8
Change
the
domain
settings
Now
that
the
new
Wordpress
site
is
set
up
and
ready
to
go
you
re
ready
to
change
the
domain
settings
of
your
temporary
site
this
assumes
that
you
set
up
the
site
on
a
temporary
domain
To
do
this
log
into
your
hosting
panel
and
find
an
icon
labeled
phpMyAdmin
and
click
Next
click
on
databases
and
then
click
the
database
for
your
Wordpress
installation
Now
find
wp
options
and
click
Line
1
will
be
for
your
site
url
Click
to
edit
this
line
and
change
it
out
the
url
from
the
temporary
one
to
the
permanent
one
Now
click
wp
options
again
click
to
edit
line
37
and
again
replace
the
temporary
url
with
the
new
one
Note
If
this
step
becomes
too
difficult
contact
customer
for
your
hosting
account
There
s
a
good
chance
that
they
can
walk
you
through
it
by
chat
or
even
make
the
change
for
you
Step
9
Forward
the
nameservers
The
next
and
final
step
is
to
forward
the
nameservers
for
your
domain
name
To
do
this
you
ll
log
into
the
dashboard
where
you
purchased
your
domain
You
ll
then
click
to
manage
the
domain
and
then
click
to
edit
the
nameservers
You
ll
do
this
by
replacing
them
with
the
nameserver
information
where
your
site
is
hosted
The
new
nameservers
will
look
something
like
this
ns1
bluehost
com
and
ns2
bluehost
com
And
that
s
it
for
transferring
a
site
from
Blogger
to
Wordpress
org
By
following
these
steps
your
new
site
will
be
ready
to
go

but
not
perfect
reason
being
you

the

Here
are
two
additions
Use

changing
your
permalinks
in

that
will
take

of

which
were

Use

Overall
useful
for

The
name
Amazon
com
has
become
synonymous
with
eCommerce
If
you
are
reading
this
blog
there
is
no
doubt
that
you
have
ordered
something
from
Amazon
com
from
the
comforts
of
your
desktop
or
laptop
computer
Today
it
is
only
slightly
less
likely
that
you
have
ordered
something
from
Amazon
from
your
phone
I
m
no
exception
Yesterday
I
ordered
a
pair
of
ear
buds
on
my
iPhone
from
Amazon
in
between
the
time
my
dental
hygienist
cleaned
my
teeth
and
the
dentist
came
in
to
give
me
the
verdict
We
asked
our
Crazy
Egg
Design
and
Marketing
Experts
to
analyze
the
Amazon
mobile
website
design
Take
a
hard
look
yourself
read
through
our
opinions
and
if
you
are
so
inclined
give
us
your
analysis
in
the
comments
below
Design
aspects
that
Amazon
s
Mobile
Homepage
is
doing
well
include
1
Using
a
simple
one
column
structure
as
a
list
view
for
the
interface
Adding
multi
column
structures
for
any
small
mobile
device
makes
the
entire
real
estate
feel
crammed
and
harder
to
use
2
Keeping
things
simple
by
introducing
high
level
functions
and
options
that
are
most
important
such
as
search
cart
wish
list
streamlined
menus
3
Information
for
the
product
is
minimal
to
start
but
if
user
is
interested
they
can
go
to
the
next
layout
with
more
details
Biggest
mistake
most
people
make
is
providing
too
much
copy
content
on
one
screen
especially
for
mobile
4
Option
to
use
full
site
at
the
bottom
Providing
the
user
the
option
to
choose
experience
is
important
5
Graphics
colors
and
overall
aesthetics
are
clean
and
minimal
which
help
performance
and
keep
maintenance
costs
lower
Cesar
Keller
Simple
Flame
The
user
experience
for
the
Amazon
Mobile
site
should
be
very
simple
make
it
as
easy
as
possible
for
someone
to
find
a
product
and
complete
a
purchase
This
successfully
achieves
that
and
by
focusing
on
the
most
popular
product
categories
Books
Kindle
Movies
and
Electronics
it
can
keep
the
navigation
as
intuitive
as
possible
I
m
also
really
happy
to
see
that
they
offer
a
clear
link
to
the
Amazon
com
full
site
It
s
amazing
how
many
mobile
sites
don
t
do
this
Robin
Cannon

Robots
The
Amazon
mobile
home
page
is
a
great
example
of
a
mobile
optimized
website
It
s
easy
to
navigate
and
gives
the
user
what
they
are
looking
for
right
away
the
amazon
search
bar
The
ad
below
the
search
bar
for
Amazon
Apps
doesn
t
appear
to
be
an
ad
at
all
and
is
very
likely
the
reason
the
user
navigated
to
Amazon
on
their
mobile
device
in
the
first
place
The
mobile
site
seems
easy
to
navigate
since
appears
very
similar
to
the
regular
website
The
cart
is
at
the
top
always
reminding
you
how
many
items
you
have
so
far
and
the
search
bar
and
department
categories
are
easy
to
navigate
as
well

Amazon
are
usability
experts
Their
website
isn
t
the
prettiest
thing
out
there
nor
is
their
mobile
site
but
they
do
an
amazing
job
of
getting
users
to
the
products
they
want
I
buy
just
about
everything
I
own
from
Amazon
and
I
do
that
not
only
because
of
pricing
but
because
it
can
be
easier
to
find
it
on
Amazon
than
my
local
retail
outlet
Retailers
are
you
listening
Given
how
much
attention
Amazon
pays
to
what
users
are
doing
on
their
site
they
most
likely
took
their
top
categories
and
made
them
easily
accessible
The
arrows
on
the
buttons
are
great
functional
suggestions
I
can
tell
that
if
I
push
Books
the
page
is
going
to
slide
down
in
an
accordion
effect
and
I
can
tell
that
if
I
push
See
All
Departments
I
m
going
to
head
off
to
another
screen
This
is
very
effective
in
letting
the
user
know
what
s
going
to
happen
To
the
savvy
user
it
lets
you
know
what
you
can
do
with
a
spotty
3G
4G
connection
and
what
you
may
want
to
wait
for
a
more
stable
connection
to
do
I
love
how
the
account
specific
and
sub
categories
are
styled
differently
This
style
change
lets
me
know
that
these
choices
are
specific
to
me
and
or
my
account
Finally
the
best
part
of
all
FULL
SITE
I
can
t
tell
you
how
many
poor
mobile
sites
I
ve
been
to
where
the
experience
was
so
lacking
I
wanted
to
go
to
the
full
site
You
know
what
those
poor
mobile
sites
all
have
in
common
They
don
t
let
you
go
to
the
full
site
A
to
Amazon
for
giving
me
the
freedom
to
choose
Christopher
Lee
Christoper
Lee
Designs
The
site
looks
very
clean
and
easy
to
use
The
theme
matches
the
www
amazon
com
theme
and
helps
promote
the
website
s
branding
The
two
containers
blue
and
yellow
have
different
styles
The
blue
one
has
rounded
corners
and
is
smaller
in
width
than
the
yellow
one
which
has
square
corners
It
might
be
more
consistent
if
they
were
both
the
same
style
unless
they
are
supposed
to
be
separated
From
the
screenshot
it
is
unclear
as
to
whether
the
department
list
is
used
when
a
search
is
done
as
is
the
case
on
the
www
amazon
com
This
is
mainly
due
to
having
advertisement
in
between
the
search
field
and
the
department
list
The
Cart
and
Wishlist
links
are
duplicated
once
up
the
top
and
once
down
the
bottom
Given
that
mobile
screen
space
is
limited
one
set
should
be
removed
Sanj

This
is
a
very
useful
mobile
page
It
has
most
of
the
features
of
the
main
site
in
a
smaller
format
with
quick
links
to
get
to
the
most
popular
items
I
would
guess
that
Amazon
has
research
or
analytics
telling
them
which
categories
are
essential
to
show
on
this
page
so
I
trust
their
judgment
I
could
nitpick
some
stuff
like
wasting
so
much
height
on
the
ad
for
the
Kindle
Fire
ensuring
that
anyone
on
an
iPhone
will
never
see
the
menus
without
scrolling
down
first
but
I
said
I
wouldn
t
nitpick
so
I
ll
stop
Brian
Schwartz
Spoke
Marketing
The
great
thing
about
the
Amazon
Mobile
home
page
design
is
the
fact
that
it
is
a
simple
design
that
one
can
identify
as
Amazon
just
by
the
fonts
and
colors
The
use
of
the
viewable
space
before
you
would
have
to
scroll
below
the
fold
is
great
The
subtle
placement
of
deals
below
the
logo
is
pretty
sly
plus
having
the
button
to
promote
the
mobile
app
below
the
search
bar
is
a
great
idea
The
end
user
may
find
it
easier
to
download
the
app
and
have
it
readily
available
then
have
to
navigate
to
Amazon
each
time
through
the
phone
s
browser
Joseph
Kalinowski
Content
Marketing
Institute
The
Amazon
mobile
home
page
does
an
impressive
job
of
presenting
their
large
and
complex
navigation
into
a
scaled
down
intuitive
menu
The
order
and
use
of
different
colors
for
the
primary
and
secondary
menus
helps
provide
visual
clarity
I
like
that
they
ve
featured
search
and
their
mobile
app
at
the
top
of
the
page
since
those
are
likely
top
actions
for
mobile
users
The
blue
primary
accent
color
leaves
orange
opposite
on
the
color
wheel
as
the
optimal
CTA
color
which
they
implemented
fairly
well
On
the
improvement
note
links
on
the
page
need
an
audit
check
for
adequate
text
size
and
padding
to
ensure
they
re
easily
clickable
Tip
Your
pinky
nail
can
work
as
a
handy
mobile
sizing
spacing
guide
for
links
since
it
s
mostly
likely
the
size
of
the
your
index
finger
s
pressable
surface
area
Angie
Schottmuller
Search
Engine
Watch
This
is
a
very
decent
way
to
show
the
most
popular
navigation
options
I
m
sure
that
Amazon
tested
this
pretty
thoroughly
before
concluding
what
people
would
click
on
most
The
only
thing
I
d
like
if
I
were
to
use
that
application
is
that
the
advertisement
was
further
down
underneath
the
departments
It
seems
more
intuitive
to
have
them
directly
underneath
the
search
box
instead
Naomi

I
think
the
Amazon
homepage
has
struck
an
excellent
balance
between
easy
navigation
to
a
lot
of
different
places
which
is
absolutely
necessary
given
the
complexity
of
the
site
and
showcasing
the
product
that
they
are
currently
trying
to
push
currently
the
Kindle
Fire
The
guideline
that
I
d
take
away
from
this
design
is
that
first
you
want
to
put
front
and
center
in
front
of
your
audience
whatever
you
want
them
to
see
and
then
immediately
give
them
access
to
anything
that
they
might
be
looking
for
Danny
Iny
Firepole
Marketing
First
I
think
it
is
clear
that
getting
the
word
out
about
Kindle
Fire
is
a
primary
goal
of
Amazon
s
I
like
the
way
the
product
is
featured
with
an
image
and
a
clear
call
to
action
without
trying
to
say
too
much
on
the
mobile
home
page
If
you
want
to
know
more
click
the
Learn
More
link
Secondly
it
is
clear
that
it
has
been
detected
that
I
am
using
an
iPhone
to
reach
the
mobile
version
of
the
website
This
has
caused
the
mobile
home
page
to
display
a
call
to
action
to
download
their
iPhone
applications
Lastly
the
navigation
is
brilliantly
organized
which
is
no
small
feat
for
a
company
that
sells
the
wide
array
of
products
that
Amazon
sells
They
list
the
most
popular
departments
on
the
home
page
and
then
a
link
to
See
All
Departments
if
you
don
t
find
what
you
are
looking
for
This
allows
them
to
serve
the
majority
of
people
without
cluttering
up
the
mobile
interface
with
links

I
think
the
navigation
is
great
And
the
color
scheme
is
transcendent
of
their
desktop
version
Amazon
s
branding
is
their
usability
digitally
at
least
They
are
missing
a
huge
oppertunity
to
harness
that
same
gut
feeling
through
their
TV
and
print
media

Engaging
voters
online
is
an
increasingly
important
part
of
the
electoral
process
The
2008
Presidential
campaign
saw
Barack
Obama
and
the
Democratic
Party
rightly
complimented
for
their
effective
use
of
web
technology
and
social
media
As
the
Republican
presidential
primary
campaign
continues
has
the
GOP
learned
some
of
those
lessons
How
are
the
four
remaining
candidates
portraying
themselves
online
Mitt
Romney
Romney
makes
a
big
mistake
immediately
by
hiding
his
main
website
behind
a
very
mundane
splash
page
The
splash
page
is
intended
to
encourage
people
to
sign
up
for
updates
about
the
campaign
and
the
need
for
any
candidate
to
develop
a
strong
user
list
is
important
But
this
call
to
action
could
easily
have
been
incorporated
into
the
main
site
right
now
the
first
experience
anyone
has
visiting
Romney
s
campaign
site
is
a
mediocre
and
unattractive
extra
step
I
m
sure
it
s
going
to
put
off
a
lot
of
visitors
Once
you
get
past
the
splash
page
Romney
has
a
pretty
appealing
site
The
layout
is
strong
and
makes
really
effective
use
of
imagery
Good
use
of
white
space
gives
a
clean
and
professional
look
It
s
easy
to
find
more
about
Romney
and
his
stance
on
the
issues
as
well
as
latest
campaign
news
It
s
also
the
only
site
that
provides
really
visible
links
to
state
specific
information
for
all
50
states
I
like
the
very
clear
calls
to
action
for
the
main
social
media
services
Facebook
Twitter
and
Google
options
to
share
major
stories
are
seamlessly
integrated
and
there
are
separate
options
for
engaging
with
the
candidate
directly
on
social
media
This
suggests
a
clear
understanding
that
there
s
a
distinction
between
building
social
media
followers
and
sharing
content
GRADE
B
Newt
Gingrich
Gingrich
s
site
scores
highly
for
usability
but
doesn
t
have
a
really
strong
visual
impact
It
s
well
put
together
but
very
traditional
in
its
layout
and
appearance
Kind
of
like
a
very
standard
blog
template
and
that
means
it
looks
dated
Navigation
is
simple
and
there
are
very
clear
calls
to
action
for
anyone
interested
in
getting
involved
with
the
campaign
donating
or
buying
campaign
related
merchandise
Social
media
seems
very
much
an
afterthought
surprising
given
that
Gingrich
has
a
massive
Twitter
following
compared
to
any
of
the
other
candidates
It
also
looks
like
some
areas
of
the
site
aren
t
updated
often
enough
As
I
write
this
there
are
still
sections
on
helping
Gingrich
win
in
the
Iowa
caucus
or
New
Hampshire
primary
both
events
that
happened
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
GRADE
C
Ron
Paul
Ron
Paul
s
the
only
candidate
using
WordPress
for
his
campaign
website
all
the
other
candidates
use
Drupal
Initial
engagement
is
strong
I
really
like
his
donation
thermometer
with
a
real
time
count
and
the
recent
donor
helps
to
suggest
that
the
Paul
campaign
engages
with
individual
people
It
makes
for
a
powerful
call
to
action
for
donations
I
was
confused
navigating
around
the
site
The
two
columns
of
articles
on
the
front
page
one
is
an
opinion
based
Paulitical
Ticker
the
other
is
Ron
Paul
in
the
News
aren
t
very
well
differentiated
The
navigation
bar
has
too
many
options
and
the
different
sections
of
the
site
could
be
more
clearly
defined
Social
media
integration
is
relatively
low
key
and
the
site
is
generally
more
wordy
than
the
others
as
indeed
Paul
is
as
a
candidate
I
think
it
would
benefit
from
a
larger
font
size
it
s
fallen
into
the
12
pixel
trap
that
might
look
OK
at
first
glance
but
isn
t
that
well
suited
to
easily
browsing
text
GRADE
B
Rick
Santorum
I
just
don
t
like
this
website
The
layout
is
odd
and
looks
very
strange
in
larger
windows
it
s
like
they
ve
tried
to
create
a
fluid
width
layout
without
really
understanding
the
principle
It
s
blocky
a
little
ugly
and
has
bad
typography
Add
in
a
lack
of
any
clear
call
to
action
and
I
m
unsure
what
the
site
is
trying
to
achieve
Even
the
language
is
a
little
unusual
with
some
sections
written
in
the
third
person
and
some
sections
written
in
the
first
person
It
gives
the
feeling
of
a
made
by
committee
website
that
doesn
t
have
any
strong
creative
vision
or
sense
of
purpose
Of
all
the
primary
candidate
websites
Santorum
s
is
the
one
that
looks
the
most
amateurish
The
first
time
it
took
me
a
few
moments
to
work
out
where
the
navigation
was
the
site
layout
works
in
such
a
way
as
to
completely
draw
the
eye
away
from
that
menu
GRADE
D
Conclusions
It
s
clear
that
the
leading
GOP
candidates
have
upped
their
game
and
understand
the
importance
of
a
good
website
former
candidates
John
Huntsman
Rick
Perry
Herman
Cain
and
Michelle
Bachmann
also
have
reasonably
polished
sites
There
s
still
a
lot
of
room
to
improve
None
of
the
sites
use
any
HTML
5
technology
their
SEO
is
basic
and
none
of
the
design
is
particularly
outstanding
The
GOP
candidates
may
have
taken
some
steps
to
improve
their
online
presence
but
they
have
a
long
way
to
go

If
you
are
a
Twitter
hashtag
veteran
bear
with
me
for
a
moment
We
will
get
to
some
advanced
stuff
shortly
For
those
that
are
new
to
Twitter
hashtags
let
s
start
with
the
basics
What
are
Twitter
Hashtags
Hashtags
are
a
way
of
organizing
Twitter
Twitter
users
are
able
to
sort
tweets
that
contain
a
particular
hashtag
By
viewing
tweets
that
contain
a
hashtag
we
are
able
to
have
conversations
about
topics
on
Twitter
For
example
any
tweet
with
the
webdesign
hashtag
added
to
it
can
be
easily
found
using
Twitter
com
or
3rd
party
tools
like
Hootsuite
and
Tweetdeck
Adding
a
hashtag
to
a
tweet
allows
it
to
go
beyond
your
own
network
to
as
many
people
that
are
following
that
hashtag
to
see
real
time
conversation
about
that
topic
You
can
see
a
hashtag
in
action
by
simply
tweeting
this
post
I
used
the
hashtag
WebDesign
in
the
title
so
everyone
who
tweets
it
will
get
to
use
one
right
off
the
bat
How
to
Use
Twitter
Hashtags
Hashtags
can
be
used
in
a
variety
of
ways
for
different
purposes
Some
useful
ways
to
use
them
include
the
following
Gain
a
Wider
Audience
for
Your
Message
Add
a
hashtag
to
your
tweets
when
relevant
to
get
a
wider
audience
for
your
update
This
way
instead
of
just
your
followers
seeing
your
latest
tweet
on
web
design
you
can
add
webdesign
to
your
tweet
to
get
anyone
who
is
following
that
hashtag
to
see
it
as
well
Capitalize
on
Trending
Topics
Be
on
the
lookout
for
trending
topic
hashtags
and
add
them
to
your
tweets
when
applicable
Use
the
Trending
topics
on
your
Twitter
homepage
to
see
the
latest
If
you
are
looking
to
target
a
local
marketing
click
on
the
change
link
to
see
trends
within
a
specific
location
If
you
re
not
sure
what
a
particular
trend
is
about
you
can
click
on
it
to
see
the
latest
tweets
or
go
to
What
the
Trend
to
see
other
user
s
explanations
of
why
something
is
popular
Monitor
Industry
News
Want
to
follow
hashtags
in
your
industry
You
can
do
it
a
few
different
ways
You
could
search
for
the
hashtag
on
Twitter
and
use
the
Save
this
search
button
to
save
it
on
your
Twitter
account
But
a
better
way
to
do
it
would
be
to
use
a
Twitter
management
tool
like
HootSuite
shown
above
Tweetdeck
or
similar
These
programs
allow
you
to
add
a
column
to
your
dashboard
with
the
hashtag
and
will
automatically
update
the
stream
as
new
tweets
come
in
In
HootSuite
you
would
click
the
Add
Stream
button
then
add
webdesign
as
your
search
query
under
the
Search
tab
In
Tweetdeck
you
would
click
the
Add
Column
button
select
Search
as
the
column
type
and
enter
webdesign
in
the
search
box
This
is
a
great
way
to
see
the
latest
tweets
on
industry
related
hashtags
You
ll
probably
see
everything
from
random
quotes
popular
articles
and
even
job
listings
Answer
Questions
on
a
Particular
Topic
Take
the
above
tip
on
following
industry
hashtags
one
step
further
by
following
questions
asked
on
a
particular
hashtag
by
using
the
search
query
webdesign
filter
links
Setting
this
search
up
on
Twitter
HootSuite
Tweetdeck
or
similar
applications
will
allow
you
to
see
questions
asked
about
a
particular
topic
mostly
without
any
links
in
the
tweet
Answer
these
questions
to
help
build
your
authority
in
the
web
design
industry
Create
Valuable
Resources
You
can
use
sites
like
Paper
li
which
will
allow
you
to
create
newspapers
around
hashtags
You
can
see
this
web
design
daily
as
an
example

the
Top

As
a

you
might
be

Topsy
Analytics
and
enter
the
platforms
mentioned
by
your
client
as
hashtags
to
see
the
number
of
people
talking
about
them
The
one
talked
about
the
most
is
probably
the
best
choice
for
your
client
and
you
as
the
designer
since
there
will
be
more

Cool
overview
Definitely
find
there
are
a
lot
of
people
out
there
who
have
a
vague
conception
about
what
hashtags
are
but
don
t
really
know
how
to
use
them
effectively
You
can
find
some
great
tweets
leading
to
great
resources
by
permanently
or
semi
permanently
following
certain
hashtags
although
I
tend
to
find
that
I
end
up
with
too
many
Tweetdeck
columns
if
I
try
and
follow
everything
I
want
If
you
re
aiming
at
an
external
audience
be
careful
of
the
hashtags
you
re
using
Most
particularly
be
aware
of
some
of
the
acronyms
that
might
be
confusing
Something
like
cms
or
ux
are
easily
recognizable
to
people
within
a
certain
industry
but
perhaps
you
re
trying
to
provide
some
resources
to
explain
or
introduce
these
topics
if
that
s
the
cause
then
the
audience
might
not
be
well
targeted
by
the
use
of
acronyms
Question
on
the
paper
li
I
often
get
tagged
as
having
contributed
to
these
but
I
can
t
remember
ever
really
getting
any
return
traffic
to
my
website
or
Twitter
follows
that
are
identifiably
from
that
source
Are
there
any
statistics
on
whether
paper
li
sites
have
any
real
audience
on
an
individual
basis
It
s
an
interesting
aggregator
service
but
certainly
I
tend
to
trust
personally
curated
sites
far
more

Hi
Robin
Good
point
on
the
acronym
hashtags
Do
you
use
Google
Analytics
I
see
paper
li
and
their
competitors
scoop
it
summify
com
in
my
Traffic
Sources
Referral
Traffic
section
With
paper
li
you
can
click
on
the
link
in
your
Referral
Traffic
to
see
which
users
papers
have
sent
the
most
traffic
and
with
the
other
two
you
can
see
which
posts
on
your
site
got
the
most
traffic
from
them

chart
And
noted
that
there
is
a
reference
to
IAD
HNL
using
the
CO
business
first
product
currently
used
on
HNL
to
EWR
and
IAH
I
m
unfmailiar
with
any
announcement
of
IAD

service
but
does
this
suggest
it
is

Shame
that
it

IMO
it

all

Starting
at

this
morning
the
Committee
on
Oversight
Government
Reform
is
carrying
a
live
feed
of
of
Eric
Holder
s
testimony
in
front
of
the
House
Oversight
and
Government
Reform
Committee
Mathew
Staver
says
due

previous
inconsistent
testimony
that
was
riddled
with
misdirection

cover
up
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder
is
being
forced
into
a
showdown
with
Rep
Darrell
Issa
and
the
committee
OGRC
today
Labeled
a
hostile
witness
by
Chairman
Issa
Holder
and
the
Department
of
Justice
must
now
satisfactorily
explain
their
roles
and
subsequent
actions
in
the
now
infamous
Fast
and
Furious
debacle
that
resulted
in
the
murder
of
a
U
S
Border
Agent
and
a
yet
to
be
determined
loss
of
life
in
Mexico
Chairman
Issa
recently
declared
that
the
Department
of
Justice
has
blood
on
their
hands
Liberty
Counsel
Action
has
launched
a
powerful
Fax
Barrage

his
committee
that
Americans
are
OUTRAGED
over

s
deplorable
performance
as
Attorney
General
Sadly
Fast

just
one
instance

gross

Eric

forced
resignation
firing

When

Groundhog
Day
Holder
repeats
Fast
and
Furious
lies
IBD
EDitorials
says
it
s
a
scandal
In
a
shameful
performance
the
attorney
general
Thursday
reprised
his
tap
dancing
routine
before
a
panel
investigating
the
Fast
and
Furious
gunrunning
operation
that
got
U
S
agents
and
Mexicans
killed
It
s
Groundhog
Day
and
Brian
Terry
s
family
and
taxpayers
are
still
waiting
for
Fast
and
Furious
answers
from
the
Justice
Department
Chairman
Darrell
Issa
said
before
the
hearings
We
will
not
wait
until
the
next
Groundhog
Day
to
get
answers
for
the
American
people
Rep
Issa
R
Calif
has
threatened
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder
with
a
contempt
of
Congress
citation
if
he
doesn
t
get
answers
to
questions
on
Fast
and
Furious
such
as
who
authorized
it
and
what
and
when
Holder
knew
The
story
constantly
changes
After
Thursday
s
deja
vu
hearing
in
front
of
Issa
s
House
Government
Oversight
Committee
we
re
still
waiting
The
attorney
general
keeps
insisting
he
didn
t
authorize
it
that
he
s
still
not
sure
when
he
became
aware
of
it
and
no
no
one
has
been
held
responsible
for
providing
weapons
to
Mexican
drug
cartels
There
is
no
attempt
at
any
kind
of
cover
up
Holder
said
under
questioning
We
have
shared
huge
amounts
of
information
and
continue
to
do
so
Rep
Dan
Burton
R
Ind
noted
that
the
Justice
Department
has
released
only
6
400
pages
of
the
93
000
pages
of
documents
related
to
Fast
and
Furious
with
the
rest
being
held
under
some
arcane
and
specious
separation
of
powers
argument
Thursday
s
hearings
came
almost
a
year
to
the
day
that
Holder
and
the
Justice
Department
sent
a
letter
to
Congress
lying
about
what
it
knew
and
what
it
did
about
Fast
and
Furious
Holder
was
appearing
for
the
third
time
to
continue
to
weave
his
tangled
web
of
deceit
and
falsehoods
As
in
the
movie
Groundhog
Day
it
is
a
fable
we
are
constantly
forced
to
relive
On
Feb
4
2011
Assistant
Attorney
General
Ron
Welch
in
response
to
the
investigations
by
Issa
and
Sen
Chuck
Grassley
R
Iowa
of
the
gun
walking
program
run
out
of
ATF
s
Phoenix
office
wrote
a
letter
stating
that
the
allegation
that
ATF
sanctioned
or
otherwise
knowingly
allowed
the
sale
of
assault
weapons
is
false
After
a
series
of
Friday
document
dumps
exposed
DOJ
s
deceit
Deputy
Attorney
General
James
Cole
in
another
letter
to
Congress
wrote
Facts
have
come
to
light
during
the
course
of
this
investigation
that
indicate
the
Feb
4
letter
contains
inaccuracies
In
other
words
the
Justice
Department
lied
to
Congress
It
lied
again
Thursday
in
the
person
of
the
attorney
general
who
once
again
failed
to
provide
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
Eric
Holder
and
his
department
have
lied
to
Congress
Scooter
Libby
was
sentenced
to
prison
for
much
less
We
await
Holder
s
fate
and
hope
justice
will
prevail

Gowdy
repeats
call
for
Holder
to
resign
the
easy
way
or
be
impeached
the
hard
way
Matthew
Boyle
is
reporting
that
South
Carolina
Republican
Rep
Trey
Gowdy
reaffirmed
his
call
for
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder
s
resignation
the
easy
way
or
impeachment
the
hard
way
during
an
interview
with
The
Daily
Caller
after
Thursday
s
House
oversight
committee
hearing
during
which
Holder
testified
about
Operation
Fast
and
Furious
While
he
was
questioning
Holder
at
the
hearing
Gowdy
explained
that
officials
at
the
Department
of
Justice
s
headquarters
were
aware
of
Fast
and
Furious
and
gun
walking
tactics
long
before
a
demonstrably
false
letter
was
sent
to
Iowa
Sen
Chuck
Grassley
claiming
otherwise
Since
the
DOJ
sent
that
letter
which
stated
it
never
let
guns
walk
it
has
withdrawn
the
letter
because
it
of
its
inaccuracies
I
think
he
wound
up
admitting
at
the
end
of
the
hearing
that
Main
Justice
knew
of
gun
walking
so
this
notion
that
we
re
going
to
blame
it
all
on
the
United
States
Attorney
s
office
in
Arizona
or
ATF
I
went
through
a
litany
of
people
all
of
them
were
Main
Justice
employees
who
knew
about
gunwalking
both
in
Fast
and
Furious
and
before
which
means
the
letter
that
was
sent
to
Senator
Grassley
was
demonstrably
false
Gowdy
told
TheDC
We
still
haven
t
gotten
any
of
his
emails
noted
Gowdy
we
don
t
have
any
documents
after
February
4
so
it
s
clear
to
me
that
people
at
Main
Justice
knew
that
gun
walking
was
going
on
in
Fast
and
Furious
It
s
also
clear
to
me
that
absolutely
nothing
has
happened
to
a
single
solitary
person
as
a
result
of
this
other
than
one
dead
Border
Patrol
agent
and
lots
of
Mexican
citizens
Beyond
that
I
can
t
find
a
single
consequence
that
has
befallen
anybody
who
knew
about
this
Regardless
of
the
mounting
evidence
that
high
ranking
officials
were
aware
of
and
approved
gun
walking
which
includes
what
Gowdy
laid
out
and
newly
public
emails
between
former
acting
ATF
director
Ken
Melson
and
Assistant
Attorney
General
Lanny
Breuer
the
head
of
the
DOJ
s
Criminal
Division
in
which
Breuer
describes
what
appears
to
be
Fast
and
Furious
gun
walking
tactics
as
a
terrific
idea
in
2009
House
oversight
committee
Democrats
claim
that
high
ranking
DOJ
officials
never
knew
about
or
approved
gun
walking
Gowdy
described
a
lengthy
report
that
the
committee
s
ranking
member
Democratic
Rep
Elijah
Cummings
released
earlier
this
week
as
demonstrably
false
Look
they
re
wrong
he
said
That
one
email
proves
it
The
phrase
Wide
Receiver
is
never
used
in
that
email
it
s
James
Trusty
and
Jason
Weinstein
they
re
talking
about
Fast
and
Furious
they
mention
gun
walking
they
talk
about
the
press
consequences
of
it
nobody
ever
gets
around
to
talking
about
the
moral
implications
of
it
they
just
more
worried
about
the
press
Gowdy
added
that
if
had
more
time
with
Holder
during
the
hearing
he
would
have
proven
how
gun
laws
already
on
the
books
if
Holder
s
DOJ
and
ATF
actually
enforced
them
rather
than
not
following
them
themselves
would
have
been
more
than
enough
to
keep
them
from
needing
to
arm
the
Mexican
drug
cartels
to
make
a
case
for
new
gun
laws
Democrats
on
the
committee
and
Holder
argued
that
new
gun
laws
would
have
kept
ATF
agents
who
weren
t
enforcing
the
gun
laws
already
on
the
books
from
letting
guns
walk
Had
we
had
another
round
of
questions
I
was
going
to
prove
to
the
Attorney
General
which
he
already
knows
that
there
are
plenty
of
gun
laws
on
the
books
right
now
that
if
used
could
have
more
than
adequately
prosecuted
this
case
Gowdy
said
So
the
notion
that
the
fix
is
We
just
got
to
get
Congress
to
pass
more
gun
laws
is
just
sheer
sophistry
And
I
could
have
proven
that
but
I
only
got
what
eight
minutes
Gowdy
might
get
another
chance
soon
The
more
hearings
the
merrier
he
told
TheDC
At
some
point
the
chairman
is
going
to
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
force
to
the
issue
of
making
DOJ
turn
over
documents
post
February
4
Gowdy
said
No
one
believes
that
they
re
doing
it
only
to
stand
on
principle
There
s
something
in
those
documents
they
do
not
want
us
to
see
So
yeah
until
we
can
answer
those
questions
they
Democrats
and
Holder
can
talk
about
politics
all
they
want
Gowdy
a
prosecutor
before
entering
politics
shrugs
off
the
partisan
criticism
against
Republicans
seeking
answers
and
accountability
for
Fast
and
Furious
victims
I
actually
worked
for
the
Justice
Department
that
was
headed
by
Janet
Reno
Bill
Clinton
s
Attorney
General
he
said
So
yeah
the
good
thing
about
prosecutors
and
law
enforcement
is
there
s
no
Republican
or
Democrat
It
s
just
the
facts
And
you
shouldn
t
be
afraid
to
disclose
them
But
for
whatever
reason
they
re
not
going
to
turn
over
those
documents
and
we
ll
stay
on
it
until
they
do
It
s
not
about
Eric
Holder
to
me
as
much
as
it
is
the
reputation
and
the
integrity
of
the
top
law
enforcement
official
in
this
country
and
the
Department
of
Justice
Gowdy
added
It
s
not
about
politics
If
it
were
about
politics
I
d
say
give
us
Jason
Weinstein
James
Trusty
Lanny
Breuer
It
s
about
being
able
to
look
my
constituents
in
the
eyes
and
say
you
can
have
trust
in
the
Department
of
Justice
because
right
now
the
way
it
looks
to
me
is
that
they
are
engaged
in
this
deflecting
the
blame
we
re
going
to
make
you
prove
it
we
re
not
going
to
give
you
documents
unless
there
s
a
court
order
That
s
just
unacceptable
to
me

Obama
can
stop
Holder
s
Fast
and
Furious
cover
up
today
The
Washington
Examiner
says
it
appears
that
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder
didn
t
read
the
executive
order
President
Obama
issued
on
his
first
day
in
the
White
House
Obama
pledged
that
his
administration
would
provide
the
American
people
with
an
unprecedented
level
of
openness
in
government
Either
he
didn
t
read
it
or
Holder
thinks
the
executive
order
doesn
t
cover
Operation
Fast
and
Furious
the
misguided
Justice
Department
program
that
allowed
thousands
of
weapons
to
be
sold
in
the
United
States
to
known
gunrunners
for
Mexican
drug
cartels
The
idea
was
the
government
would
then
track
the
walked
guns
thus
enabling
prosecution
of
cartel
figures
by
linking
them
to
particular
weapons
found
at
crime
scenes
But
officials
lost
track
of
an
estimated
1
400
such
guns
two
of
which
turned
up
at
the
scene
of
U
S
Border
Patrol
Agent
Brian
Terry
s
slaying
in
Arizona
in
December
2010
Terry
s
slaying
sparked
a
national
uproar
and
prompted
an
investigation
by
the
House
Oversight
and
Government
Reform
Committee
chaired
by
Rep
Darrell
Issa
The
committee
described
the
response
of
Holder
s
department
to
that
investigation
in
a
report
released
last
Thursday
For
months
the
department
has
stonewalled
committee
document
requests
and
refused
to
comply
with
committee
subpoenas
The
department
has
produced
scores
of
blacked
out
pages
containing
no
information
and
many
duplicate
documents
in
order
to
bolster
its
page
count
Recently
the
Justice
Department
s
Inspector
General
office
disclosed
that
it
has
reviewed
approximately
80
000
pages
of
documents
related
to
Fast
and
Furious
and
conducted
approximately
70
interviews
in
its
investigation
That
investigation
is
not
even
close
to
completion
In
comparison
the
department
has
produced
just
over
6
000
pages
to
Congress
representing
only
8
of
the
materials
available
to
the
IG
The
department
is
withholding
92
of
the
documents
it
has
given
the
IG
Also
Congress
has
conducted
22
interviews
only
31
of
the
total
the
IG
has
already
conducted
If
the
department
granted
Congress
access
to
all
the
documents
and
witnesses
available
to
the
IG
it
would
be
much
closer
to
determining
who
was
actually
responsible
for
Fast
and
Furious
The
committee
s
use
of
the
word
stonewall
is
significant
The
word
became
famous
when
President
Nixon
and
his
senior
aides
used
it
in
discussing
their
response
to
inquiries
about
the
Watergate
break
in
of
1972
It
led
in
turn
to
the
now
familiar
maxim
that
the
cover
up
is
always
worse
than
the
original
crime
Holder
and
his
fellow
Obama
political
appointees
at
the
Justice
Department
aren
t
kidding
anybody
within
or
outside
Congress
They
are
furiously
stonewalling
the
Issa
panel
s
investigation
even
as
they
hide
behind
an
obviously
empty
claim
that
they
are
defending
the
separation
of
powers
between
Congress
and
the
executive
branch
When
only
8
percent
of
the
requested
documents
are
produced
and
witnesses
either
refuse
to
testify
while
citing
their
Fifth
Amendment
right
against
self
incrimination
or
are
barred
from
testifying
by
their
executive
branch
superiors
it
becomes
obvious
that
the
political
appointees
are
covering
up
actions
that
are
either
criminal
in
nature
or
that
they
fear
would
be
politically
damaging
to
Obama
If
Obama
meant
what
he
wrote
in
his
first
executive
order
the
cover
up
by
his
Justice
Department
appointees
could
stop
as
soon
as
he
orders
it
If
he
doesn
t
he
endorses
the
cover
up

An
oldie
but
goodie
Gunrunner
Fast
and
Furious
was
one
of
the
first
things
that
Obama
and
Holder
did
when
they
assumed
power
Posted
before
but
needs
to
be
revisited
The
simple
fact
is
Barack
Obama
was
the
architect
of
Fast
Furious
Holder
was
the
contractor
On
March
24
2009
just
sixty
days
after
the
inauguration
Deputy
Attorney
General
David
Ogden
announced
from
the
White
House
that
the
president
has
directed
us
to
take
action
and
Attorney
General
Holder
and
I
have
taken
several
new
and
aggressive
steps
In
government
terms
that
s
that
s
a
Priority
I
project
That
s
a
fast
track
project
Ogden
goes
on
to
describe
those
aggressive
steps
saying
to
fortify
its
Project
Gunrunner
specifically
to
facilitate
gun
tracing
How
can
Holder
hide
from
the
fact
that
he
initiated
Project
Gunrunner
Fast
Furious
at
the
direction
of
Barack
Obama
The
evidence
This
public
statement
from
Deputy
Attorney
General
Ogden

When
and
How
to
Respond
to
a
Negative
Review
Posted

Kelly

No
Comments
A
former
client
wrote
an
unflattering
review
of
your
services
and
now
you
re
worried
about
how
this
will
affect
future
business
Fortunately
WeddingWire
allows
you
to
Respond
to
reviews
in
an
effort
to
remedy
the
situation
and
deflect
potential
damage
but
it
s
important
to
consider
when
and
how
you
respond
By
responding
appropriately
to
a
client
s
review
even
if
you
don
t
agree
with
their
comments
you
show
that
you
take
a
personal
interest
in
your
business
and
care
to
make
it
better
Before
you
get
started
keep
these
few
tips
in
mind
Your
responses
are
made
public
on
WeddingWire
Don
t
write
anything
you
wouldn
t
want
a
potential
client
to
see
If
you
come
across
as
aggressive
argumentative
or
disingenuous
potential
customers
will
see
this
as
a
turn
off
and
eliminate
you
from
their
list
of
potential

Write
with
your
prospects
in
mind
Respond
when
you
re
at
fault
If
someone
leaves
a
review
with
legitimate
concerns
and
complaints
it
s
in
your
best
interest
to
try
to
correct
the
situation
Apologize
and
explain
why
it
won
t
happen
again
and
offer
a
remedy
to
the
particular
situation
Respond
when
the
review
states
incorrect
information
Politely
correct
the
reviewer
Sometimes
a
review
is
written
for
the
incorrect
business
so
step
in
and
take
this
as
an
opportunity
to
educate
potential
customers
on
your
pricing
policies
and
business
practices
Don
t
add
fuel
to
the
fire
Some
clients
will
never
be
satisfied
with
the
service
you
provided
Don
t
waste
your
time
trying
to
convince
them
otherwise
and
encourage
other
clients
to
write
a
positive
review
to
balance
this
one
out
Never
respond
when
you
re
still
angry
Whether
you
had
a
bad
day
or
the
client
was
difficult
to
please
remember
that
you
can
t
satisfy
everyone
Personal
attacks
and
a
defensive
attitude
will
not
win
you
future
business
Keep
it
simple
When
you
choose
it
s
appropriate
to
respond
keep
your
comments
to
about
5
concise
sentences
and
move

Be
proactive

On
January
9
we
eagerly
announced
the
2012
winners
of
WeddingWire
Bride
s
Choice
Awards
The
prestigious
annual
awards
program
recognizes
the
best
local
wedding
vendors
from
the
WeddingWire
Network
who
demonstrate
excellence
in
quality
service
responsiveness
and
professionalism
within
the
wedding
industry
It
was
with
great
pleasure
that
we
congratulated
the
winners
for
their
continued
professionalism
and
commitment
to
enriching
the
wedding
planning
experience
for
engaged
couples
Now
we
re
thrilled
to
share
the
benefits
and
successes
directly
from
some
of
our
award
winning
wedding
professionals
WeddingWire
has
been
an
invaluable
tool
in
helping
to
grow
my
business
Engaged
couples
need
to
feel
confident
in
their
choice
of
vendors
and
the
reviews
on
WeddingWire
provide
just
that
The
Bride
s
Choice
Award
is
a
recognition
that
a
vendor
has
performed
well
on
a
consistent
basis
throughout
the
year
and
that
recognition
benefits
both
the
vendor
and
the
couple
The
couples
I
meet
tell
me
how
impressed
they
are
with
my
work
and
reviews
What
could
be
better
than
that

We
re
very
honored
and
excited
to
have
received
WeddingWire
s
Bride
s
Choice
Award
for
the
3
rd
year
in
a
row
We
ve
found
that
engaged
couples
want
to
read
reviews
from
past
clients
especially
because
a
lot
of
a
wedding
planner
s
offerings
are
intangible
peace
of
mind
attention
to
detail
organization
and
stress
reduction
By
providing
prospective
clients
with
access
to
read
what
our
previous
clients
have
said
about
their
experience
working
with
us
is
HUGE

For
those
couples
that
find
us
online
for
the
first
time
they
read
through
the
reviews
and
have
a
chance
to
really
get
to
know
us
We

Having
reviews
in
one
place
on
my
WeddingWire
storefront
has
been
a
great
part
of
successfully
booking
engaged
couples
People
want
to
read
reviews
and
feel
more
assured
with
their
choice
in
a
vendor
I
m
grateful
to
my
past
clients
for
leaving
reviews
providing
future
clients
with
the
confidence
to
choose
my
business

Pinterest
has
been
spreading
the
nation
like
wildfire
allowing
users
to
pin
photos
and
inspiration
of
their
favorite
recipes
clothing
hair
designs
and
more
Many
brides
and
hopeful
brides
have
been
using
Pinterest
as
a
new
way
to
organize
inspiration
for
their
weddings
Take
advantage
of
this
new
social
vertical
to
spread
photos
and
links
from
your
website
and
blog
It
is
important
to
keep
a
few
SEO
Search
Engine
Optimization
considerations
in
mind
Here
are
three
areas
to
make
sure
you
are
optimizing
your
photos
on
Pinterest
for
SEO
Description
When
you
set
up
your
profile
consider
including
some
of
your
relavent
keywords
and
details
in
your
Pinterest
description
make
sure
to
include
your
category
i
e
Photographer
Florist
DJ
and
the
word
weddings
if
this
is
your
primary
business
This
way
when
potential
clients
are
searching
on
Google
or
Pinterest
you
can
increase
your
chances
of
showing
up
as
a
result
Boards
Choose
the
title
of
your
Pin
Boards
carefully
This
is
another
area
to
include
keywords
consider
doing
so
both
in
the
title
and
description
of
the
boards
where
you
organize
your
types
of
photos
Images
Ensure
you
are
using
the
proper
direct
links
to
the
photo
from
your
website
or
blog
so
that
you
get
the
added
benefits
when
your
photos
go
viral
and
those
who
share
your
images
are
properly
directed
back
to

Something
occurred
to
me
recently
Times
have
really
changed
We
no
longer
live
in
a
world
where
Ricky
Martin
is
having
to
swear
he
isn
t
gay
Instead
he
s
having
to
swear
that
he
isn
t
gay
married
I
never
thought
I
d
see
the
day
But
here
we
are
with
6
states
Massachusetts
Iowa
New
York
New
Hampshire
Vermont
and
Connecticut
and
the
District
of
Columbia
proudly
offering
marriage
licenses
to
all
couples
gay
and
straight
alike
while
another
2
states
Maryland
and
Washington
have
opened
the
2012
season
jockeying
to
see
which
can
claim
to
be
the
eighth
jurisdiction
to
legalize
gay
marriage
Further
there
are
several
other
states
including
Illinois
Hawaii
Delaware
Rhode
Island
and
New
Jersey
offering
civil
unions
and
other
broad
partnership
recognition
rights
to
same
sex
couples
You
can
learn
more
about
the
map
of
marriage
equality
here
This
means
that
Wedding
Pros
in
these
areas
should
be
making
some
conscious
decisions
about
their
marketing
materials
and
the
audience
to
whom
they
wish
to
speak
if
they
haven
t
already
done
so
More
than
ever
gay
and
lesbian
couples
are
out
there
and
the
audience
is
listening

Just
over
four
years
ago
in
a
supermarket
far
far
away
Harvard
basketball
coach
Tommy
Amaker
bumped
into
Zack
Rosen
s
dad
shopping
while
a
high
school
basketball
tournament
was
going
on
in
Trenton
N
J
It
was
chronicled
in
an
investigative
piece
by
the
New
York
Times
on
some
potentially
dirty
recruiting
by
the
Harvard
basketball
program
We
really
should
get
Zack
up
to
Harvard
Amaker
reportedly
said
to
Rosen
s
father
about
recruiting
the
high
school
stud
Or
as
I
like
to
imagine
it
went
a
little
something
like
this
Darth
Vader
Luke
you
do
not
yet
realize
your
importance
You
have
only
begun
to
discover
your
power
Join
me
and
I
will
complete
your
training
With
our
combined
strength
we
can
end
this
destructive
conflict
and
bring
order
to
the
galaxy
Luke
I
ll
never
join
you
Darth
Vader
If
you
only
knew
the
power
of
the
Dark
Side
If
only
Zack
had
known
the
power
Had
he
joined
the
Dark
Side
he
could
have
won
his
first
Ivy
League
title
last
year
He
could
be
well
on
his
way
to
the
NCAA
tournament
this
season
He
could
be
on
a
nationally
ranked
team
No
regrets
right
Harvard
is
the
antagonist
to
the
Ivy
saga
this
year
a
growing
danger
challenging
the
traditional
Ivy
power
structure
of
Penn
and
Princeton
In
a
short
period
of
time
Harvard
has
become
the
Yankees
the
Cowboys
the
Heat
of
the
Ivy
League
the
team
everyone
loves
to
hate
Why
Many
complain
about
Harvard
s
rise
Perhaps
it
was
predicated
on
some
less
than
proper
recruiting
Maybe
Amaker
has
ruffled
a
few
feathers
along
the
way
Who
cares
The
Crimson
are
the
league
s
target
for
no
reason
other
than
the
fact
that
they
win
The
same
is
true
of
Penn
football
which
the
rest
of
the
league
despises
simply
because
of
the
Quakers
dominance
over
the
last
two
decades
Honestly
it
s
more
fun
this
way
Penn
fans
complain
about
the
recent
drought
of
Ivy
titles
but
isn
t
a
little
more
league
parity
fun
There
s
a
new
favorite
and
a
new
challenger
each
year
Every
league
needs
a
villain
Even
more
a
villain
is
exactly
what
Penn
basketball
needs

Strong

hopes

Freshman
Kara
Bonenberger
s
play
in
the
post
will
be
vital
in
establishing
an
offensive
rhythm
and
helping
break
Penn
s
slump
Even
with
Valentine
s
Day
fast
approaching
the
Penn
women
s
basketball
team
was
unable
to
catch
a
break
as
they
will
return
to
a
land
of
heartbreak
this
weekend
The
Quakers
8

Ivy
will
travel
to
Harvard
11
8
4
1
on
Friday
a
place
where
third
year
coach
Mike
McLaughlin
has
watched
the
Crimson
pull
out
down
to
the
wire
games
in
his
two
previous
trips
In
McLaughlin
s
first
season
a
1
24
Penn
team
fell
55
52
on
a
three
with
1
3
seconds
left
Last
season
the
Crimson
survived
two
overtime
periods
and
38
points
from
Alyssa
Baron
to
win
88
84
If
the
Quakers
want
to
avoid
repeating
history
they
will
have
to
bring
it
offensively
For
us
to
shoot
a
higher
percentage
the
ball
is
going
to
have
to
get
inside
McLaughlin
said
pointing
to
freshman
forward
Kara
Bonenberger
as
the
only
player
shooting
above
40
percent
Penn
is
currently
second
to
last
in
field
goal
percentage
and
last
in
three
point
shooting
percentage
in
the
Ivy
League
Despite
their
lack
of
success
from
beyond
the
arc
the
Quakers
attempted
33
threes
against
Brown
in
their
most
recent
game
which
they
lost
in
overtime
We
re
not
a
team
that
shoots
threes
at
a
high
rate
anyway
McLaughlin
said
And
when
we
end
up
taking
33
of
them
that
s
never
going
to
work
for
us
He
believes
the
team
has
often
settled
for
perimeter
looks
against
attacking
zone
defenses
that
prevent
them
from
establishing
an
inside
presence
We
definitely
need
to
get
the
ball
in
the
post
Baron
said
That
will
open
up
things
from
the
outside
too
so
that
we
re
not
shooting
as
many
threes
or
threes
from
as
deep
I
think
we
just
need
to
focus
more
on
looking
at
the
post
in
the
first
place
and
throwing
it
in
there
making
a
good
pass
for
them
Penn
did
receive
encouraging
performances
from
post
players
Katy
Allen
and
Bonenberger
last
weekend
The
pair
averaged
11
and
8
5
points
over
the
two
games
respectively
I
think
Kara
kind
of
struggled
a
bit
for
about
five
or
six
games
maybe
a
little
bit
with
her
confidence
but
I
thought
she
played
two
really
good
games
last
weekend
and
I
think
that
s
only
going
to
help
her
McLaughlin
said
She
s
a
confidence
kid
And
if
she
feels
good
about
what
she
s
doing
then
I
think
the
sky
s
the
limit
Allen
s
role
has
obviously
increased
since
starting
forward
Jess
Knapp
got
hurt
and
I
think
she
has
handled
herself
great
he
added
Penn
mired
in
a
1
9
slide
after
a
program
best
start
will
also
face
a
similarly
struggling
Dartmouth
squad
Saturday
Something
will
have
to
give
in
a
matchup
between
two
teams
that
each
have
a
lone
Ivy
win
over
Columbia
Last
year
we
let
that
game
slip
away
too
Baron
said
referring
to
a
68
65
road
defeat
to
the
Big
Green
We
re
definitely
looking
to
get
in
there
and
take
advantage
of
them
McLaughlin
feels
that
the
team
s
attitude
has
not
significantly
changed
through
the
season
but
acknowledged
it
s
tough
after
starting
out
winning
seven
of
nine
games
and
then
losing
nine
of
10
It
is
important
mentally
for
the
Quakers
not
only
to
play
well
but
also
to
find
a
way
back
into
the
win
column
according
to
McLaughlin
I
think
confidence
and
morale
is
naturally
boosted
when
you
find
a
way
to
win

DePaul
Offers
Birth
Control
in
Health
Plan
Amid
the
Republican
led
furor
over
the
Obama
administration
s
requirement
that
even
religious
affiliated
employers
provide
prescription
birth
control
the
nation
s
largest
Catholic
university
said
this
week
it
covers
contraception
as
part
of
its
health
care
benefit
package
The
1
800
employee
university
covers
contraception
in
both
its
fully
insured
HMO
plan
and
its
self
insured
PPO
DePaul
responded
to
a
complaint
from
the
Equal
Employment
Opportunity
Commission
several
years
ago
and
added
artificial
contraception
as
a
benefit
to
its
Blue
Cross
PPO
DePaul
University
s
admission
seems
to
contradict
the
Republican
refrain
that
the
contraception
requirement
which
is
part
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
is
an
unprecedented
attack
on
religious
freedom
The
rule
exempts
houses
of
worship
and
religious
nonprofits
but
some
Catholics
say
that
protection
is
too
narrow
While
the
Vatican
for
the
most
part
opposes
contraception
98
percent
of
sexually
active
Catholic
women
use
birth
control
The
Affordable
Care
Act
provision
was
modeled
on
contraceptive
coverage
requirements
already
on
the
books
in
28
states
including
Illinois
Nonetheless
Obama
signaled
he
may
pull
out
of
that
policy
in
the
face
of
mounting
GOP
opposition
DePaul
you
may
remember
also
scored
dead
last
on
a
campus
sexual
health
report
card
released
by
Trojan
it
was
139
out
of
141
last
year
too
Contraceptive
availability
factored
into
the
rankings
so
we
wonder
exactly
how
the
Blue
Demons
must
have
irked
Trojan
maybe
they
prefer
Durex

First
I
d
like
to
thank
the
Catholic
church
and
Republicans
for
reminding
me
why
I
remain
a
lapsed
Catholic
This
is
complete
bullshit
plain
and
simple
How
the
Evangelicals
and
Catholics
got
so
cozy
I
have
no
idea
When
I
was
growing
up
I
was
the
lone
Catholic
kid
in
a
small
town
public
school
class
full
of
Fundamentalists
and
Evangelicals
I
was
thought
to
be
a
freak
who
practiced
some
type
of
mystical
religion
But
that
s
the
past
I
find
it
ironic
that
the
Republicans
are
couching
this
is
a
big
government
intrusion
and
a
violation
of
religious
freedom
but
are
perfectly
fine
with
taking
away
my
individual
right
to
obtain
contraception
through
my
healthcare
plan
Who
s
playing
big
government
now
I
have
to
wonder
though
if
Viagra
is
offered
as
part
of
a
Catholic
University
or
hospital
s
healthcare
package
Is
that
medically
necessary
Maybe
ED
is
God
s
way
of
saying
to
give
it
up
It
s
his
own
version
of
birth
control
ChicagoD
In
fairness
it
does
seem
as
if
ED
meds
should
at
least
require
a
sperm
viability
test
Navin
Johnson
Yeah
I
guess
it
s
nice
that
right
wing
Christians
have
gone
beyond
essentially
calling
Catholicism
a
cult
Strange
bedfellows
ChicagoD
Not
so
strange
Kind
of
an
inevitable
and
unfortunate
reaction
to
the
movement
for
equality
of
women
Reproductive
freedom
is
something
they
can
both
agree
on
Most
of
the
rest
of
their
theology
clashes
pretty
dramatically
if
you
actually
are
one
of
them
less
so
if
it
is
all
esoterica
to
you
but
on
this
issue
the
priests
and
the
pastors
see
eye
to
eye
The
interesting
difference
seems
to
be
the
Catholic
laity
has
just
moved
past
the
issue
Even
among
people
who
go
to
Mass
send
the
kids
to
school
etc
I
never
hear
of
this
being
an
issue
At
most
it
is
not
the
right
choice
for
us
but
may
be
for
other
people
I
don
t
know
many
evangelicals
but
the
position
seems
more
grass
roots
with
them
In
other
words
the
bishops
either
alienate
their
base
or
have
them
nod
smile
and
ignore
The
pastors
seem
to
get
support
for
this
Nicholas
As
Rachel
Maddow
said
If
altar
boys
could
get
pregnant
the
Catholic
Church
would
be
all
for
contraception
BlueFairlane
I
m
not
really
a
fan
of
Rachel
Maddow
but
that
is
funny
Navin
Johnson
When
you
think
that
it
s
basically
male
clergy
bigwigs
vs
99
of
women
out
there
it
s
one
of
the
first
things
that
comes
to
mind
Navin
Johnson
These
requirements
have
been
there
for
over
a
decade
back
through
Bush
s
two
terms
and
before
This
is
bullshit
plain
and
simple
jcuvs
Though
it
should
be
mentioned
that
neither
the
student
health
services
center
SAGE
nor
the
basic
additional
Aetna
student
coverage
offer
birth
control
coverage
or
discounts
ChicagoD
No
free
rubbers
at
the
student
health
center
I
guess
I
get
that
It
s
a
Catholic
institution
and
all
but
sheesh
McKinley
used
to
give
out
such
huge
batches
of
free
rubbers
that
nobody
I
mean
nobody
could
possibly
have
been
getting
laid
that
much

Did
John
Wayne
Gacy
Act
Alone
Today
s
lead
story
in
the
Sun
Times
is
about
the
possibility
that
serial
killer
John
Wayne
Gacy
may
have
had
at
least
an
accomplice
in
three
of
his
murders
Criminal
defense
attorneys
Robert
Stephenson
and
Steven
Becker
re
examined
the
cases
of
Russell
Nelson
of
Minneapolis
and
Robert
Gilroy
and
John
Mowery
of
Chicago
they
were
among
the
29
of
Gacy
s
33
victims
found
under
the
crawlspace
of
his
Norwood
Park
home
in
1979
Becker
and
Stephenson
reviewed
Gacy
s
work
and
travel
records
which
they
say
indicated
he
was
out
of
town
when
Nelson
and
Gilroy
disappeared
They
also
contend
Gacy
s
work
records
didn
t
leave
him
enough
time
to
abduct
and
kill
Mowery
The
evidence
seems
to
strongly
indicate
Gacy
had
accomplices
in
the
Gilroy
and
Nelson
deaths
Stephenson
said
Gacy
flew
to
Pittsburgh
on
Sept
12
1977
and
returned
to
Chicago
on
Sept
16
1977
Robert
Gilroy
was
reported
missing
Sept
15

Russell
Nelson
went
missing
Oct
19
1977
while
he
and
a
friend
were
at
a
bar
in
Chicago
Nelson
s
mother
said
the
friend
later
gave
her
a
different
account
of
his
disappearance
and
revealed
the
friend
offered
two
of
Nelson
s
brothers
jobs
in
Chicago
with
Gacy
Stephenson
said
he
and
Becker
are
ready
and
willing
to
share
their
findings
with
Cook
County
Sheriff
Tom
Dart
including
thee
name
of
Nelson
s
friend
Dart
s
office
has
been
working
to
identify
the
remains
of
Gacy
s
eight
John
Doe
victims
through
DNA
testing
since
last
summer
Two
presumed
victims
were
found
to
be
living
alive
and
well
in
Florida
and
Oregon
while
the
remains
of
one
of
the
John
Does
was
identified
as
William
George
Bundy
This
isn
t
the
first
time
that
it
s
been
presumed
Gacy
had
accomplices
Gacy
himself
suggested
that
to

2
s
Walter

a

years

Star
game
yesterday
when
he
was
named
as
a
reserve
for
the
Eastern
Conference
team
Despite
slightly
lower
stats
than
in
past
seasons
and
missing
seven
games
due
to
an
injured
wrist
Deng
was
selected
by
the
league
s
coaches
to
play
in
the
mid
season
exhibition
and
will
join
Derrick
Rose
in
Orlando
when
the
league
s
top
players
take
the
court
on
Feb
26
Averaging
16
points
7
3
rebounds
and
2
5
assists
Deng
s
scoring
has
been
down
this
year
yet
he
remains
the
team
s
second
leading
scorer
and
critical
to
the
team
s
success
The
Bulls
hold
an
NBA
best
22
6
record
but
three
of
the
Bulls
six
losses
came
during
that
seven
game
stretch
that
Deng
sat
out
Bulls
head
coach
Tom
Thibodeau
said
before
Deng
s
selection
was
announced
Lu
s
play
speaks
for
itself
He
plays
great
defense
He
plays
a
great
floor
game
He
moves
without
the
ball
He
makes
the
extra
pass
You
can
t
measure
his
impact
statistically
I
know
what
he
brings
I
know
all
the
coaches
and
all
his
teammates
appreciate
everything
that
he
does
Fellow
All
Star
Rose
also
should
be
relieved
that
Deng
will
be
joining
him
in
Orlando
I
know
that
I
d
probably
be
more
hurt
than
Lu
if
he
doesn
t
make
it
the
league
s
MVP
said
Wednesday
night
Knowing
that
he
has
a
nonchalant
attitude
about
making
the
team
But
I
think
that
he
deserves
it
We
do
too
During
his
eight
year
career
he
has
performed
at
a
level
worthy
of
All
Star
consideration
This
year
he
finally
got
the
recognition
for
his
contribution
to
the
Bulls
success

Tikiphiles
Rejoice
Paul
McGee
And
The
Melman
Brothers
To
Open
A
Tiki
Bar
Ever
since
Paul
McGee
announced
he
was
leaving
The
Whistler
rumors
have
swirled
about
what
exactly
he
was
going
to
do
next
We
knew
he
was
joining
up
with
Lettuce
Entertain
You
and
we
had
heard
something
about
a
country
bar
with
the
Melman
boys
Frankly
a
country
bar
no
matter
how
good
the
whiskey
list
didn
t
really
get
us
cocktail
nerds
going
so
our
attention
waned
Imagine
our
newfound
excitement
when
we
heard
that
half
of
the
project
was
going
to
be
a
brand
new
Tiki
Bar
McGee
has
been
a
promoter
of
tiki
style
cocktails
for
years
and
we
ve
enjoyed
his
tiki
nights
at
the
Whistler
Tiki
in
Chicago
aside
from
those
brief
moments
at
The
Whistler
has
been
in
something
of
a
deep
freeze
since
Trader
Vic
s
closed
last
year
Looks
like
the
rum
umbrellas
fruit
juices
and
palm
fronds
are
coming
back
Below
the
country
themed
bar
will
be
a
sophisticated
4
000
square
foot
Tiki
lounge
where
visitors
can
enjoy
classic
drinks
featuring
fresh
squeezed
juices
and
other
exotic
ingredients
The
tiki
bar
no
name
yet
will
have
it
s
own
private
entrance
and
supposedly
will
boast
the
city
s
most
extensive
rum
collection
To
assuage
the
fears
of
those
accustomed
to
Melman
properties
like
Sub
51
and
Studio
Paris
this
will
not
be
a
nightclub
nor
will
the
focus
be
on
the
scene
McGee
told
Time
Out
Chicago
that
the
tiki
bar
will
be
serious
about
the
quality
of
the
drinks
we
wouldn
t
expect
anything
less
and
R
J
Melman
emphasized
that
unlike
nightclubs
bars
are
inclusive
We
couldn
t
be
more
excited
about
this
One
of
the
best
mixers
in
the
city
with
a
serious
personal
love
for
tiki
drinks
will
be
mixing
up
our
Royal
Hawaiians
Mai
Tais
and
whatever
else
he
comes
up
with
Plus
we
don
t
have
to
feign
enthusiasm
about
yet
another
pre
prohibition
style
cocktail
bar
with
arm
banded
mixologists
You
can
bet
we
ll
be
there
on
opening
night
The
new
bar
will
be
located
at
435
N
Clark
Street

In
a
recent
interview
with
the
Dartmouth
College
blog
Dartbeat
Ty
Segall
said
he
will
release
two
new
albums
within
the
next
six
months
in
addition
to
his
upcoming
collaboration
with
White
Fence
Thanks
to
Robert
Szypko
for
the
tip
Segall
says
the
first
LP
will
be
a
mini
LP
for
In
the
Red
collecting
eight
songs
written
and
recorded
with
his
touring
band
Of
the
record
he
said
The
live
band
is
so
much
different
than
me
recording
stuff
on
my
own
it
s
a
lot
harder
and
louder
The
other
album
will
as
usual
be
written
and
recorded
by
Segall
on
his
own
and
will
be
released
via
Drag
City
Of
his
previously
reported
collaboration
with
White
Fence
titled
Hair
and
also
forthcoming
from
Drag
City
Segall
said
It
doesn
t
really
sound
like
either
one
of
us
It
s
kinda
like
starting
a
new
band
He
added
It
sounds
a
bit
more
drug
influenced
a
bit
more
psychedelic
and
weird

Let
s
call
this
an
album
OK
In
any
case
Fucked
Up
have
been
releasing
long
songs
for
each
year
of
the
Chinese
Zodiac
since
2006
although
they
re
running
a
little
behind
at
the
moment
The
Year
of
the
Tiger
ended
in
February
2011
we
ve
passed
through
the
Rabbit
Year
and
are
now
in
the
Dragon
Year
Year
of
the
Tiger
is
a
pair
of
tracks
that
have
been
around
for
a
while
the
band
claimed
to
have
finished
the
title
song
almost
two
years
ago
It
s
the
first
music
we
ve
heard
from
the
band
in
a
while
that
doesn
t
have
some
formal
connection
to
their
David
Comes
to
Life
project
Year
of
the
Tiger
itself
is
a
15
minute
song
with
a
very
long
lyric
apparently
by
guitarist
Mike
Haliechuk
about
an
aging
tiger
approaching
his
death
Fucked
Up
s
lead
bellower
Damian
Abraham
gets
most
of
the
words
to
himself
although
he
s
also
got
some
support
former
Del
Byzanteens
singer
keyboardist
Jim
Jarmusch
yes
fine
he
s
a
director
too
intones
a
few
verses
and
either
Annie
Claude
Desch
nes
of
Duchess
Says
or
Katie
Stelmanis
of
Austra
or
both
add
the
pretty
hey
I
can
actually
sing
vocals
that
FU
have
been
using
for
contrast
with
Abraham
s
voice
over
the
past
few
years
The
marvelous
thing
about
Year
of
the
Tiger
is
that
it
s
actually
a
fully
constructed
song
not
a
vamp
with
solos
or
a
chain
of
vaguely
related
pieces
segued
together
it
builds
and
builds
and
builds
with
one
new
riff
after
another
uncoiling
itself
and
wrapping
around
the
pillar
of
all
the
others
It
s
bombastic
as
hell
of
course
the
keyboard
part
is
the
closest
Fucked
Up
have
ever
come
to
Meat
Loaf
but
this
is
the
product
of
a
band
that
thinks
big
The
song
s
weak
point
is
its
lyrics
which
have
lots
of
sharply
observed
images
his
castle
of
gristle
and
bone
but
also
too
many
passages
with
dodgy
or
overwrought
diction
that
deathly
coddle
of
light
Abraham
s
guttural
howl
is
a
great
equalizer
of
lyrics
but
the
sung
sections
reveal
the
words
awkwardness
Lines
such
as
Light
drips
like
paint
from
heaven
A
shining
pall
on
the
horizon
are
easier
to
get
away
with
screamed
than
chirped
Fucked
Up
s
blog
describes
the
second
side
of
Year
of
the
Tiger
Onno
as
a
weird
rager
which
is
about
right
It
appears
to
be
a
full
on
22
minute
instrumental
palindrome
a
pyramidal
stack
of
drones
and
riffs
with
a
crashing
forward
and
backward
beat
the
closest
thing
they
ve
ever
produced
to
Melvins
more
extreme
recordings
or
to
H
sker
D
s
Dreams
Reoccurring
For
a
studio
experiment
it
s
exceptionally
listenable
Again
this
band
is
great
at
arrangements
and
every
five
second
segment
of
this
record
sounds
almost
but
not
quite
like
the
one
next
to
it
If
it
were
in
a
movie
soundtrack
it
d
have
to
be
in
a
sequence
with
a
violently
strobing
red
light
It
s
too
much
too
much
too
much
exactly
what
we
rely
on
Fucked
Up
for
that
is
Who
would
ask
for
anything
less

Tourist
Spots
in
New

That
Are
Actually
Good
Any
number
of
guidebooks
newspaper
articles
airline
magazine
roundups
or
TV
shows
can
give
first
time
New
York
visitors
a
lengthy
eating
itinerary
Unfortunately
their
recommendations
aren
t
always
the
best
When
we
hear
a
tourist
tell
us
that
they
re
planning
on
going
to
Norma
s
for
breakfast
Magnolia
for
a
late
morning
snack
Lombardi
s
for
lunch
Carmine
s
for
dinner
and
Serendipity
3
for
dessert
well
we
get
a
little
bit
sad
inside
NYC
is
a
killer
food
town
those
sorts
of
places
don
t
show
you
why
The
good
news
Some
oft
visited
tourist
destinations
really
do
have
great
food
A
few
may
be
a
little
pricey
or
a
little
crowded
some
might
not
be
the
uncontested
best
in
their
field
But
they
re
all
widely
known
places
that
shouldn
t
leave
a
visitor
disappointed
Check
out
the
list
and
stay
tuned
tomorrow

places
tourists
don
t
go
but
should

Gonen
Chief
Strategy
Officer
Last
week
Gartner
released
the
2011
Magic
Quadrant
for
User
Authentication
I
sat
down
with
SafeNet
s
VP
of
Products
and
Marketing
Tsion
Gonen
to
shed
some
light
on
SafeNet
s
position
in
the
quadrant
and
what
it
s
all
about
In
Part
1
of
our
interview
he
explained
what
the
Magic
Quadrant
is
and
why
making
the
Leader
s
quadrant
is
so
special
In
Part
2
we
discussed
the
authentication
landscape
as
a
whole
and
in
this
post
we
talk
about
SafeNet
s
authentication
solution
and
their
place
in
the
world
of
strong
authentication
Q
How
is
SafeNet
s
authentication
solution
different
from
the
other
vendors
listed
in
the
Magic
Quadrant
Tsion
SafeNet
s
philosophy
is
to
provide
one
management
system
that
allows
customers
to
evolve
their
authentication
approach
as
their
needs
change
without
changing
their
infrastructure
Other
vendors
provide
products
but
we
provide
an
authentication
infrastructure
We
re
actually
quite
religious
about
this
Even
though
most
of
our
authentication
solutions
were
brought
in
by
acquisitions
they
are
all
still
managed
by
a
single
platform
Gartner
specifically
cited
several
areas
of
strength
for
SafeNet
an
innovative
and
broad
authentication
portfolio
some
of
the
strongest
products
in
the
market
clear
technical
vision
and
strategies
positive
customer
experience
competitive
pricing
Q
Is
this
position
of
leadership
something
customers
and
partners
can
expect
in
the
coming
years
Tsion
Yes
We
have
a
strong
belief
that
customer
satisfaction
innovative
leadership
as
well
as
our
technology
and
our
product
must
continue
to
improve
SafeNet
is
a
data
protection
company
We
provide
companies
ways
to
control
access
to
data
as
well
as
control
and
encrypt
data
itself
Authentication
plays
a
significant
role
and
has
a
very
strong
place
in
the
plan
We
will
continue
to
evolve
to
serve
our
customers
future
security
needs

we
found
the
following
customer
behaviors
Three
out

four
resellers
report
that
customers
are
more
or
much
more
concerned
about
security
breaches
now
than
they
were
a
year
ago
More
than
seven
out
of
ten
resellers
are
actively
discussing
with
their
customers
the
authentication
and

of
their

More

45
percent
of
responders
indicate
that
customers
have
expressed
interest
in
these

solutions
Sixty
seven
percent
of

An
article
this
week
in
the
UK
s
MailOnline
reports
how
hackers
have
cracked
the
latest
generation
of
security
devices
compromising
the
accounts
of
millions
of
online
banking
customers
The
security
devices
used
by
some
UK
banks
appear
to
be
tokens
which
generate
a
dynamic
one
time
passcode
OTP
Bank
customers
log
onto
their
bank
sites
with
an
OTP
instead
of
using
a
regular
static
password
OTP
strong
authentication
is
effective
in
validating
the
identity
of
the
customer
logging
onto
the
online
banking
site
But
it
isn
t
enough
to
validate
any
transactions
that
a
customer
may
carry
out
after
logging
in
The
financial
fraud
described
in
the
article
was
the
result
of
Man
in
the
Browser
attacks
which
are
caused
by
malware
that
has
infected
a
user
s
computer
The
malware
kicks
in
after
the
customer
has
already
logged
into
the
site
It
hijacks
the
online
transaction
and
siphons
money
into
criminal
accounts
The
attacks
show
that
strong
authentication
by
itself
cannot
protect
online
banking
customers
against
fraud
resulting
from
man
in
the
browser
attacks
Nevertheless
there
are
ways
to
prevent
this
type
of
attack
from
being
successful
The
first
is
for
the
customer
to
validate
each
and
every
transaction
This
can
be
achieved
if
the
customer
signs
the
transaction
with
an
electronic
signature
Another
way
of
preventing
the
attack
is
to
bank
online
from
a
trusted
browser
The
trusted
browser
is
stored
on
a
disk
on
key
When
the
customer
wants
to
bank
online
they
connect
the
flash
drive
to
their
computer
and
the
trusted
browser
loads
Since
the
trusted
browser
is
stored
in
its
own
secure
environment
it
is
not
susceptible
to
malware
in
the
same
way
that
a
regular
browser
is
SafeNet
has
been
saying
for
quite
a
time
that
strong
authentication
by
itself
is
not
enough
to
protect
online
transactions
It
offers
transaction
signing
and
security
solutions
which
are
intended
specifically
to
protect
against
Man
in
the
Browser
attacks
These
include
the
SafeNet
eToken
3500
sign
what
you
see
token
and
the
SafeNet
Trusted
Browsing
Platform
At
the
end
of
the
day
only
transaction
security
solutions
like
these
combined
with
strong
authentication
can
offer
online
banking
customers
protection
against
malware

The
smart
grid
is
the
first
major
effort
to
modernize
an
energy
infrastructure
that
has
remained
largely
unchanged
over
the
past
several
decades
Over
the
past
50
years
electricity
networks
have
not
kept
pace
with
modern
challenges
such
as
Security
threats
from
either
energy
suppliers
or
cyber
attack
National
goals
to
employ
alternative
power
generation
sources
whose
intermittent
supply
makes
maintaining
stable
power
significantly
more
complex
Conservation
goals
that
seek
to
lessen
peak
demand
surges
during
the
day
so
that
less
energy
is
wasted
in
order
to
ensure
adequate
reserves
High
demand
for
an
electricity
supply
that
is
uninterruptible
Digitally
controlled
devices
that
can
alter
the
nature
of
the
electrical
load
and
result
in
electricity
demand
that
is
too
much
for
the
outdated
analog
system
For
a
simple
example
timed
Christmas
lights
can
present
significant
surges
in
demand
because
they
come
on
at
near
the
same
time
sundown
or
a
set
time
Without
the
kind
of
coordination
that
a
smart
grid
can
provide
the
increased
use
of
such
devices
lead
to
electric
service
reliability
problems
power
quality
disturbances
blackouts
and
brownouts
With
the
evolution
of
utility
consumption
production
energy
companies
needed
a
better
way
to
monitor
supply
and
manage
utility
systems
First
they
developed
Automatic
Meter
Reading
in
the
1980s
and
over
the
following
decade
developed
Advanced
Metering
Infrastructure
Security
AMI
security
which
was
able
to
store
how
electricity
was
used
at
various
times
during
the
day
This
information
was
invaluable
but
the
last
15
years
have
brought
on
even
more
challenges
and
demand
on
utility
providers
requiring
them
to
add
an
even
more
advanced
monitoring
and
communication
system
This
is
called
the
Smart
Grid
Smart
grids
work
with
the
AMI
to
create
a
network
of
links
between
customers
and
utility
companies
that
provides
increased
insight
into
and
management
of
energy
consumption
cost
and
workload
across
the
entire
energy
grid
But
because
energy
utilities
play
such
a
vital
part
of
our
everyday
lives
smart
grid
technologies
introduce
new
smart
grid
security
issues
and
challenges
that
must
be
addressed
Implementing
a
smart
grid
without
proper
smart
grid
protection
could
result
in
grid
instability
loss
of
private
information
utility
fraud
and
unauthorized
access
to
energy
consumption
data
In
the
upcoming
months
we
will
take
a
good
hard
look
at
smart
grid
technology
and
security
giving
you
an
inside
look
at
how
to
build
secure
and
manage
the
smart
grid

An
article
this
week
in
the
UK
s
MailOnline
reports
how
hackers
have
cracked
the
latest
generation
of
security
devices
compromising
the
accounts
of
millions
of
online
banking
customers
The
security
devices
used
by
some
UK
banks
appear
to
be
tokens
which
generate
a
dynamic
one
time
passcode
OTP
Bank
customers
log
onto
their
bank
sites
with
an
OTP
instead
of
using
a
regular
static
password
OTP
strong
authentication
is
effective
in
validating
the
identity
of
the
customer
logging
onto
the
online
banking
site
But
it
isn
t
enough
to
validate
any
transactions
that
a
customer
may
carry
out
after
logging
in
The
financial
fraud
described
in
the
article
was
the
result
of
Man
in
the
Browser
attacks
which
are
caused
by
malware
that
has
infected
a
user
s
computer
The
malware
kicks
in
after
the
customer
has
already
logged
into
the
site
It
hijacks
the
online
transaction
and
siphons
money
into
criminal
accounts
The
attacks
show
that
strong
authentication
by
itself
cannot
protect
online
banking
customers
against
fraud
resulting
from
man
in
the
browser
attacks
Nevertheless
there
are
ways
to
prevent
this
type
of
attack
from
being
successful
The
first
is
for
the
customer
to
validate
each
and
every
transaction
This
can
be
achieved
if
the
customer
signs
the
transaction
with
an
electronic
signature
Another
way
of
preventing
the
attack
is
to
bank
online
from
a
trusted
browser
The
trusted
browser
is
stored
on
a
disk
on
key
When
the
customer
wants
to
bank
online
they
connect
the
flash
drive
to
their
computer
and
the
trusted
browser
loads
Since
the
trusted
browser
is
stored
in
its
own
secure
environment
it
is
not
susceptible
to
malware
in
the
same
way
that
a
regular
browser
is
SafeNet
has
been
saying
for
quite
a
time
that
strong
authentication
by
itself
is
not
enough
to
protect
online
transactions
It
offers
transaction
signing
and
security
solutions
which
are
intended
specifically
to
protect
against
Man
in
the
Browser
attacks
These
include
the
SafeNet
eToken
3500
sign
what
you
see
token
and
the
SafeNet
Trusted
Browsing
Platform
At
the
end
of
the
day
only
transaction
security
solutions
like
these
combined
with
strong
authentication
can
offer
online
banking
customers
protection
against
malware

The
smart
grid
is
the
first
major
effort
to
modernize
an
energy
infrastructure
that
has
remained
largely
unchanged
over
the
past
several
decades
Over
the
past
50
years
electricity
networks
have
not
kept
pace
with
modern
challenges
such
as
Security
threats
from
either
energy
suppliers
or
cyber
attack
National
goals
to
employ
alternative
power
generation
sources
whose
intermittent
supply
makes
maintaining
stable
power
significantly
more
complex
Conservation
goals
that
seek
to
lessen
peak
demand
surges
during
the
day
so
that
less
energy
is
wasted
in
order
to
ensure
adequate
reserves
High
demand
for
an
electricity
supply
that
is
uninterruptible
Digitally
controlled
devices
that
can
alter
the
nature
of
the
electrical
load
and
result
in
electricity
demand
that
is
too
much
for
the
outdated
analog
system
For
a
simple
example
timed
Christmas
lights
can
present
significant
surges
in
demand
because
they
come
on
at
near
the
same
time
sundown
or
a
set
time
Without
the
kind
of
coordination
that
a
smart
grid
can
provide
the
increased
use
of
such
devices
lead
to
electric
service
reliability
problems
power
quality
disturbances
blackouts
and
brownouts
With
the
evolution
of
utility
consumption
production
energy
companies
needed
a
better
way
to
monitor
supply
and
manage
utility
systems
First
they
developed
Automatic
Meter
Reading
in
the
1980s
and
over
the
following
decade
developed
Advanced
Metering
Infrastructure
Security
AMI
security
which
was
able
to
store
how
electricity
was
used
at
various
times
during
the
day
This
information
was
invaluable
but
the
last
15
years
have
brought
on
even
more
challenges
and
demand
on
utility
providers
requiring
them
to
add
an
even
more
advanced
monitoring
and
communication
system
This
is
called
the
Smart
Grid
Smart
grids
work
with
the
AMI
to
create
a
network
of
links
between
customers
and
utility
companies
that
provides
increased
insight
into
and
management
of
energy
consumption
cost
and
workload
across
the
entire
energy
grid
But
because
energy
utilities
play
such
a
vital
part
of
our
everyday
lives
smart
grid
technologies
introduce
new
smart
grid
security
issues
and
challenges
that
must
be
addressed
Implementing
a
smart
grid
without
proper
smart
grid
protection
could
result
in
grid
instability
loss
of
private
information
utility
fraud
and
unauthorized
access
to
energy
consumption
data
In
the
upcoming
months
we
will
take
a
good
hard
look
at
smart
grid
technology
and
security
giving
you
an
inside
look
at
how
to
build
secure
and
manage
the
smart
grid

Last
week
Gartner
released
the
2011
Magic
Quadrant
for
User
Authentication
I
sat
down
with
SafeNet
s
VP
of
Products
and
Marketing
Tsion
Gonen
to
shed
some
light
on
SafeNet
s
position
in
the
quadrant
and
what
it
s
all
about
In
Part
1
of
our
interview
he
explained
what
the
Magic
Quadrant
is
and
why
making
the
Leader
s
quadrant
is
so
special
In
Part
2
we
discussed
the
authentication
landscape
as
a
whole
and
in
this
post
we
talk
about
SafeNet
s
authentication
solution
and
their
place
in
the
world
of
strong
authentication
Q
How
is
SafeNet
s
authentication
solution
different
from
the
other
vendors
listed
in
the
Magic
Quadrant
Tsion
SafeNet
s
philosophy
is
to
provide
one
management
system
that
allows
customers
to
evolve
their
authentication
approach
as
their
needs
change
without
changing
their
infrastructure
Other
vendors
provide
products
but
we
provide
an
authentication
infrastructure
We
re
actually
quite
religious
about
this
Even
though
most
of
our
authentication
solutions
were
brought
in
by
acquisitions
they
are
all
still
managed
by
a
single
platform
Gartner
specifically
cited
several
areas
of
strength
for
SafeNet
an
innovative
and
broad
authentication
portfolio
some
of
the
strongest
products
in
the
market
clear
technical
vision
and
strategies
positive
customer
experience
competitive
pricing
Q
Is
this
position
of
leadership
something
customers
and
partners
can
expect
in
the
coming
years
Tsion
Yes
We
have
a
strong
belief
that
customer
satisfaction
innovative
leadership
as
well
as
our
technology
and
our
product
must
continue
to
improve
SafeNet
is
a
data
protection
company
We
provide
companies
ways
to
control
access
to
data
as
well
as
control
and
encrypt
data
itself
Authentication
plays
a
significant
role
and
has
a
very
strong
place
in
the
plan
We
will
continue
to
evolve
to
serve
our
customers
future

for

I
sat
down
with

Chief
Strategy
Officer
Tsion

on

position

Part

of

interview
he
explained
what
the
Magic
Quadrant
is
and
why
making
the
Leaders
quadrant
is
so
special
In
this
post
we
talk
about
the
authentication
landscape
as
a
whole
and
SafeNet
s
place
in
it
Q
How
is
the
2011
Magic
Quadrant
for
User
Authentication
different
from
previous
years
Tsion
This
is
the
first
year
Gartner
has
done
a
quadrant
for
User
Authentication
which
shows
a
change
in
the
dynamics
of
the
market
We
are
shifting
from
the
tried
and
true
standard
of
One
Time
Password
OTP
authentication
to
a
more
complex
more
heterogeneous
authentication
market
Companies
are
realizing
that
there
is
no
one
size
fits
all
authentication
solution
anymore
They
are
turning
to
companies
who
have
a
robust
management
platform
and
a
portfolio
of
authentication
solutions
It
also
shows
that
customer
satisfaction
is
king
The
traditional
revenue
leaders
were
placed
in
the
Challengers
quadrant
because
they
paid
less
attention
to
customer
satisfaction
than
SafeNet
Q
Did
the
breaches
of
2011
help
shape
the
authentication
landscape
Tsion
Absolutely
There
were
three
significant
changes
in
the
way
people
and
companies
thought
about
authentication
after
the
breaches
last
year
First
companies
realized
that
no
one
is
immune
Second
the
industry
learned
that
complacency
can
hurt
You
can
t
stand
still
and
expect
things
you
re
doing
now
to
work
next
year
Everything
changes
and
you
have
to
keep
up
with
the
threats
And
third
companies
began
to
understand
that
no
matter
what
you
do
on
the
perimeter
you
have
to
protect
the
data
It
s
interesting
the
RSA
breach
could
have
caused
people
to
turn
away
from
authentication
but
instead
it
brought
authentication
to
top
of
mind
Companies
realized
what
happens
when
they
don
t
have
strong
authentication
and
they
started
asking
questions
about
how
their
authentication
products
are
secured
Obviously
this
brought
a
lot
of
replacement
business
to
SafeNet
Stay
tuned
for
the
next
post
as
we
discuss
SafeNet
s
authentication
solution
and
its
place
in
the
world
of
authentication

I

why
is
Freelancify
better
for
me
1
We
don
t
charge
a
membership
or
nickel
and
dime
you
just
to
look
for
jobs
it
s
free
until
you
actually
win
a
project
2
The
Q
A
boards
on
each
project
level
the
playing
field
so
that
quality
knowledge
and
customer
service
stands
out
much
more
than
just
who
s
cheapest
You
also
won
t
have
to
fight
against
waves
of
generic
copy
paste
bidders
as
our
closed

Unlike
the
other
Burger
joints
we
only
use
all
Natural
Beef
Chicken
and
Salmon
in
our
burgers
This
means
our
Burgers
are
free
of
antibiotics
hormones
and
are
fed
a
vegetarian
diet
Why
do
we
use
all
natural
proteins
For
the
same
reason
we
hand
cut
our
fries
fresh
every
day
and
hand
dip
our
Milk
Shakes
Malts
and
Root
Beer
Floats
Because
we
work
here
we
know
our
customers
and
this
is
what
we
eat
everyday
The
great
thing
about
being
a
small
locally
owned
business
is
that
you
can
still
be
a
little
different

Imaging
cell
cytoskeletons
during

leads
researchers
to
uncover
a
new
regulator

C
elegans
embryonic
cells
with
plasma
membranes
in
purple
and
myosin
motors
in
yellow
The
embryo
has
26
cells
at
this
stage
and
two
of
the
cells
are
about
to
become
internalized
moving
from
the
surface
to
the
interior
Goldstein

Cytoskeletal
contractions
during
embryonic
development
occur
long
before
there
are
any
visible
changes
in
cell
shape
suggesting
something
other
than
actin
and
myosin
contractions
trigger
the
morphogenetic
changes
that
result
in
the
formation
of
multilayered
embryos
from
single
layers
of
cells
according
to
new
research
In
a
paper
published
today
February
9
in
Science
a
research
team
led
by
developmental
biologist
Bob
Goldstein
at
the
University
of
North
Carolina
at
Chapel
Hill
presented
evidence
that
the
cellular
changes
that
initiate
the
formation
of
germ
layers
are
triggered
by
a
novel
molecular
clutch
which
anchors
the
continually
contracting
network
of
actomyosin
in
cells
to
contact
points
on
neighboring
cells
In
the
past
couple
of
years
with
the
imaging
and
microscopy
that
s
being
done
people
are
really
starting
to
appreciate
that
this
process
can
be
really
dynamic
said
Adam
Martin
a
developmental
biologist
at
the
Massachusetts
Institute
of
Technology
who
was
not
involved
in
the
research
What
this
study
really
shows
is
that
you
can
regulate
contractility
at
the
tissue
level
by
regulating
the
attachment
between
this
contractile
machine
and
the
attachment
between
neighboring
cells
In
the
model
worm
Caenorhabditis
elegans
the
process
of
gastrulation
when
the
three
germ
layers
that
will
give
rise
to
all
the
tissues
and
organs
become
properly
positioned
begins
around
90
minutes
after
the
first
cell
division
when
two
cells
out
of
a
single
layer
of
26
begin
to
shrink
on
one
side
and
squeeze
past
their
neighboring
cells
toward
the
center
of
the
embryo
Goldstein
s
former
graduate
student
Minna
Roh
Johnson
initially
wanted
to
visualize
the
cytoskeletons
of
C
elegans
during
this
process
However
Goldstein
was
skeptical
that
Roh
Johnson
would
learn
anything
from
such
an
endeavor
I
just
assumed
that
we
d
look
at
the
actin
and
myosin
and
at
these
cell
surfaces
shrinking
and
we
d
see
everything
moving
at
once
and
we
d
be
none
the
wiser
Goldstein
recalled
Cells
internalizing
from
the
surface
of
a
em
C
elegans
em
embryo
The
outer
surface
of
two
internalizing
cells
are
shown
in
blue
the
myosin
motors
in
green
and
the
plasma
membranes
in
red
span
Goldstein
lab
UNC
Chapel
Hill
span
But
Roh
Johnson
proceeded
using
spinning
disk
confocal
microscopy
to
visualize
cells
with
a
fluorescently
labeled
cell
membrane
and
myosin
particles
As
expected
she
observed
the
actomyosin
networks
of
the
two
cells
flex
and
shrink
as
their
outer
surfaces
began
constricting
However
when
she
watched
the
cells
before
any
change
in
cell
shape
began
she
was
surprised
to
see
similar
contractions
in
their
cytoskeletons
I
kept
looking
earlier
and
earlier
thinking
the
contractions
would
stop
at
some
point
but
they
didn
t
she
said
Right
when
these
cells
are
born
they
already
had
these
movements
occurring
which
was
very
unexpected
Not
only
was
the
cell
s
actin
myosin
meshwork
pulsating
shrinking
and
remodeling
itself
for
more
than
20
minutes
before
any
changes
in
cell
shapes
were
visible
it
was
also
doing
so
at
speeds
similar
to
those
that
occur
when
the
cell
does
begin
to
change
shape
By
cutting
into
the
actin
myosin
meshwork
using
a
UV
laser
beam
and
then
measuring
the
speed
at
which
the
network
recoiled
the
researchers
also
determined
that
the
tensile
strength
of
the
network
was
just
as
strong
at
earlier
time
points
before
gastrulation
Labeling
the
outer
surface
of
the
cell
membranes
with
quantum
dots
revealed
that
they
were
as
dynamic
as
the
cytoskeletons
moving
along
with
every
contraction
Instead
what
changed
over
time
was
that
the
cytoskeletal
movements
of
the
two
worm
cells
became
increasingly
linked
with
the
movements
of
the
contact
zones
shared
with
neighboring
cells
It
is
this
gradual
coupling
of
the
actomyosin
network
with
specific
cell
adhesion
points
that
seems
to
trigger
the
shrinking
of
the
cells
outer
surfaces
allowing
the
cells
to
squeeze
into
the
center
of
the
embryo
As
these
networks
are
coming
in
they
re
not
attached
to
the
cell
cell
borders
Goldstein
explained
Instead
we
speculate
that
there
s
something
in
between
that
functions
sort
of
as
a
clutch
Although
this
molecular
clutch
remains
to
be
characterized
the
researcher
found
that
knocking
down
certain
proteins
such
as
cadherin
which
is
involved
in
cell
adhesion
and
Rac
which
is
involved
in
intracellular
signaling
disrupts
the
process
Because
this
mechanism
is
conserved
in
Drosophila
melanogaster
Goldstein
believes
it
might
extend
to
other
higher
organisms
and
may
underlie
the
formation
and
closure
of
the
human
neural
tube
failure
of
which
is
a
common
birth
defect

How
the
Zebra
Got
Its
Stripes
Zebras
may
have
evolved
their
striped
coat
to
avoid
blood
sucking
flies

Many
a
fable
and
tale
propose
preposterous
theories
about
how
the
zebra
got
its
stripes
but
now
science
has
finally
provided
a
possible
answer
According
to
new
research
published
in
the
Journal
of
Experimental
Biology
zebras
black
and
white
coloration
helps
protect
the
equids
from
blood
sucking
horseflies
which
find
the
stripes
unattractive
It
s
all
about
how
light
is
reflected
Susanne
Akesson
from
Lund
University
told
BBC
Nature
Akesson
found
that
light
reflected
off
black
and
brown
horses
is
horizontally
polarized
which
was
very
attractive
to
flies
From
a
white
coat
you
get
unpolarized
light
she
explained
which
doesn
t
adhere
to
a
specific
plane
This
the
flies
find
less
attractive
Given
the
flies
penchant
for
dark
coats
Akesson
and
her
colleagues
wondered
how
zebras
might
fare
They
placed
boards
that
were
all
black
all
white
and
black
and
white
striped
in
a
field
covered
them
with
insect
glue
then
counted
the
number
of
flies
that
got
stuck
to
each
Strikingly
the
striped
board
that
most
closely
represented
a
zebra
s
stripes
had
the
fewest
flies
That
was
a
surprise
because
in
a
striped
pattern
you
still
have
these
dark
areas
that
are
reflecting
horizontally
polarized
light
Akesson
told
BBC
But
the
narrower
and
more
zebra
like
the
stripes
the
less
attractive
they
were
to
the
flies
The
team
also
put
the
fly
glue
on
three
differently
colored
3
dimensional
horse
models
Once
again
the
striped
model
attracted
the
fewest
flies
But
whether
or
not
the
flies
are
the
true
reason
for
the
zebras
stripes
remains
to
be
seen
Above
all
for
this
explanation
to
be
true
the
authors
would
have
to
show
that
tabanid
fly
bites
are
a
major
selection
pressure
on
zebras
but
not
on
horses
and
donkeys
found
elsewhere
in
the
world
none
of
which
are
stripy
evolutionary
biologist
Matthew
Cob
of
the
University
of
Manchester
told
BBC
My
hunch
is
that
there
is
not
a
single
explanation
and
that
many
factors
are
involved
in
the
zebra
s
stripes

The
National
Institutes
of
Health
is
seeking
input
from
the
scientific
community
on
the
new
National
Institute
of
Substance
Use
and
Addiction
Disorders
working
title
scheduled
to
open
in
2014
The
proposed
institute
is
the
result
of
a
November
2010
recommendation
from
the
Scientific
Management
Review
Board
that
the
NIH
should
reorganize
all
substance
use
abuse
and
addiction
related
research
at
the
Institutes
Both
the
National
Institute
on
Drug
Abuse
and
the
National
Institute
on
Alcohol
Abuse
and
Alcoholism
will
be
dissolved
and
their
research
programs
folded
into
the
new
institute
The
NIH
is
asking
for
comments
about
potential
scientific
opportunities
and
public
health
needs
that
should
be
included
in
the
new
Institute
s
strategic
plan
Those
comments
can
be
submitted
electronically
and
will
be
accepted
through
May
11
2012
The
NIH
will
also
conduct
a
series
of
public
meetings
to
discuss
the
new
Institute
which
will
be
posted
on
the
NIH
s

A

A
newly

method
might
be
able
to
detect
sound

produced

THE
DEVICE
If
a
bacterium
belches
in
a
petri
dish
does
anyone
hear
it
In
the
January
issue
of
Physical
Review
Letters
researchers
at
LMU
Munich
in
Germany
describe
the
world
s
tiniest
ear
an
apparatus
for
the
ultrasensitive
detection
of
sound
By
tracking
the
displacement
of
a
levitating
gold
particle
trapped
in
a
focused
laser
beam
the
team
recorded
the
acoustic
vibrations
of
nearby
nanoparticles
The
researchers
were
also
able
to
determine
from
which
direction
the
sound
came
The
researchers
estimate
the
nano
ear
can
detect
sound
levels
as
low
as
60
decibels
making
the
device
a
million
times
more
sensitive
than
human
hearing

WHAT
S
NEW
Optical
tweezers
infrared
lasers
focused
through
an
optical
microscope
to
trap
tiny
objects
are
a
standard
tool
used
to
study
cells
metal
particles
DNA
and
more
Researchers
can
move
the
laser
beam
to
pick
up
and
manipulate
these
objects
studying
their
motion
But
the
LMU
Munich
team
put
the
technique
to
a
different
use
We
were
wondering
what
happens
if
something
disturbs
this
motion
for
instance
a
sound
wave
said
first
author
Alexander
Ohlinger
If
it
s
possible
to
detect
that
disturbance
we
could
use
the
optical
tweezers
as
a
microphone
Ohlinger
and
colleagues
tested
their
theory
in
two
experiments
First
they
recorded
the
trapped
particle
s
response
to
a
relatively
strong
sound
source
a
needle
vibrating
on
a
loudspeaker
Next
they
detected
the
significantly
weaker
acoustics
of
a
patch
of
vibrating
gold
nanoparticles
being
heated
up
by
a
laser
see
image
above
In
both
instances
the
acoustic
waves
were
detected
accurately
IMPORTANCE
The
nano
ear
could
open
up
a
whole
new
field
of
acoustic
microscopy
said
Ohlinger
Using
optical
tweezers
scientists
might
be
able
to
listen
in
on
bacteria
viruses
and
even
cellular
processes
like
DNA
replication
and
mitosis
The
technique
is
highly
accessible
as
all
the
tools
that
were
used
lasers
nanoparticles
a
dark
field
microscope
and
an
ordinary
video
camera
to
record
the
movement
can
be
readily
acquired
by
a
lab
Ohlinger
added
NEEDS
IMPROVEMENT
Before
the
technique
can
be
applied
to
biological
systems
however
work
must
be
done
to
reduce
the
signal
to
noise
ratio
said
Lene
Oddershede
head
of
the
optical
tweezers
group
at
the
University
of
Copenhagen
who
was
not
involved
in
the
study
When
you
re
at
the
nanoscale
noise
is
a
really
big
player
It
s
everywhere
she
said
With
the
noise
to
signal
ratio
reported
in
the
paper
these
extraneous
noises
could
affect
the
intended
measurements
However
I
do
believe
the
signal
to
noise
ratio
can
be
improved
Oddershede
said
The
LMU
Munich
team
is
now
performing
studies
applying
the
nano
ear
to
different
systems
said
Ohlinger
They
would
like
to
record
the
sound
of
micro
sized
objects
like
cells
but
first
have
to
determine
if
the
technique
can
record
sound
waves
that
are
not
periodic
as
in
their
experiments
but
random
and
messy
We
have
to
refine
our
method
but
in
principle
we
hope
that
it
s
possible
to
use
in
biology
said
Ohlinger
This
is
all

without

said

that

these

The

was
developed
by
a

that
met
over

and
involved

When
I
first
saw
the
Knook
closeup
I
had
no
idea
what
to
think
about
it
You
always
hear
about
double
ended
knitting
needles
or
a
cro
hook
for
crochet
but
have
you
ever
seen
an
item
that
is
half
knitting
and
half
crochet
This
is
a
neat
little
invention
that
will
soon
become
your
best
friend
The
Knook
is
a
specialized
crochet
hook
that
has
a
cord
threaded
through
a
hole
in
the
non
hook
end
The
cord
holds
the
stitches
while
you
work
allowing
you
to
create
a
knitted
fabric

According

There
s
an
App
for
That
We
know
sleevefacing
is
sort
of
five
minutes
ago
but
it
remains
a
meme
of
note
The
basic
idea
behind
sleevefacing
is
to
create
a
photograph
that
picks
up
where
an
album
cover
leaves
off
by
adding
surrounding
elements
from
the
real
world

to

Was
a
Win
During
yesterday
s

the
music
tagging
app
Shazam
which
has
been
making
inroads
into
television
programming
helped
approximately
half
of

their

who

brings
an

to

Participants
at
Boston
Music
Hack
Day
2010
will
converge
to
create
operational
music
technologies
over
a
single
weekend

Hundreds
of
music
technologists
will
enter
Boston
Music
Hack
Day
this
weekend
and
okay
hundreds
of
technologists
will
leave
too
Before
they
do
they
ll
spend
an
action
packed
weekend
at
Microsoft
s
aptly
named
New
England
Research
and
Development
Center
NERD
inventing
building
and
presenting
music
apps
hardware
hacks
and
art
projects
The
official
rules
are
simple
Music
software
hardware
art
the
web
Anything
goes
as
long
as
it
s
music
related
Mere
mortals
such
as
myself
are
often
shocked
by
the
pace
of
innovation
these
days
which
is
mostly
due
to
the
dedication
ingenuity
and
yes
occasionally
genius
of
the
coders
and
makers
who
build
the
technology
we
use
every
day
Music
is
no
exception
At
Boston
Music
Hack
Day
on
October
16th
and
17th
you
can
literally
see
this
innovation
happen
either
in
person
or
through
a
live
video
stream
There
s
even
a
T
shirt
courtesy
of
a
crowdsourced
design
challenge
So
what
will
you
see
Lots
of
smart
people
building
the
next
generation
of
smart
music
applications
everything
from
powerful
listening
tools
you
might
use
every
day
to
completely
whimsical
creations
like
The
Swinger
created
at
San
Francisco
s
Music
Hack
Day
which
famously
enforced
a
swing
beat
on
hits
like
Guns
N
Roses
Sweet
Child
O
Mine
as
noted
by
Boing
Boing
and
others
Music
Hack
Days
where
technology
enthusiasts
gather
to
build
both
serious
creations
and
off
the
wall
apps
like
The
Swinger
have
sprung
up
in
many
of
the
world
s
tech
hotspots
since
the
first
event
was
held
in
London
last
July
The
previous
Boston
Music
Hack
Day
drew
over
350
software
wizards
hardware
tinkerers
and
members
of
the
press
eager
to
witness
the
creation
of
new
technologies
Designer
Jocelyn
Petko
of
Alburtis
Pennsylvania
won
the
24
hour
long
contest
to
design
the
T
shirt
for
Boston
Music
Hack
Day
with
this
design
On
Saturday
and
Sunday
participants
will
build
their
ideas
with
each
team
presenting
their
creations
on
Sunday
evening
in
the
hopes
of
winning
a
variety
of
prizes
Sponsors
of
the
event
include
Collecta
extensions
fm
Microsoft
NERD
MTV
Mozilla
MusiXMatch
SonicBids
SoundCloud
TicketFly
and
The
Echo
Nest
which
publishes
Evolver
fm
Read
more
about
the
relationship
between
Evolver
fm
and
The
Echo
Nest
We
re
currently
witnessing
the
dawn
of
another
digital
music
revolution
as
the
media
player
migrates
from
hardware
to
software
more
specifically
to
web
and
mobile
apps
that
apply
powerful
data
APIs
to
innovative
ideas
that
would
never
be
feasible
on
a
pure
hardware
level
Hardware
interfaces
continue
to
be
important
but
because
MP3
players
can
be
code
now
they
have
the
potential
to
do
a
lot
more
than
they
could
just
a
few
years
ago
I
was
there
when
Steve
Jobs
announced
the
iPod
but
these
days
even
Steve
Jobs
knows
apps
are
where
the
action
is
I
m
not
the
only
one
looking
forward
to
seeing
this
year
s
creations
in
all
their
forms
Here
s
that
livestream
link
again
and
to
whet
your
appetite
some
more
photos
from
last
year
s
event
Stay
tuned
throughout
the
weekend
for
more
Boston

Day
coverage

that
we

Boston
Music
Hack
Day
Music
Accelerometer
Watch
Already
Works
A
mere
three
hours
into
this
year
s
Boston
Music
Hack
Day
a
group
of
hackers
who
found
each
other
on
an
IRC
channel
had
already
managed
to
build
a
system
that
allows
people
to
create
music
through
gestures
while
wearing
an
accelerometer
enabled
watch
Robby
Grodin
a
computer
science
and
music
technology
major
at
Northeastern
University
built
part
of
the
software
in
Max
MSP
during
one
of
his
classes
yesterday
This
morning
while
listening
to
companies
at
Boston
Music
Hack
Day
present
APIs
for
all
the
hackers
to
play
with
Grodin
asked
via
IRC
who
else
wanted
to
build
something
with
Max
MSP
Among
those
to
respond
was
freelance
hacker
Lindsey
Mysse
whose
Texas
Instruments
EZ430
Chronos
watch
recently
arrived
following
a
lengthy
back
order
Their
team
quickly
ballooned
to
a
small
de
facto
development
group
which
colonized
a
at
Microsoft
s
NERD
Center
in
Boston
None
of
them
expected
to
have
the
thing
up
and
running
so
quickly
Here
s
how
it
works
The
watch
s
accelerometer
tracks
acceleration
in
the
X
Y
and
Z
axes
and
sends
that
information
via
RF
to
a
dongle
attached
to
Mysee
s
laptop
which
then
passes
it
wirelessly
to
a
frequency
modulation
synthesizer
Max
MSP
patch
on
Grodin
s
laptop
which
turns
the
movements
into
sound
The
X
access
is
the
carrier
frequency
the
Y
axis
is
the
modulator
ratio
to
the
carrier
and
the
Z
axis
is
the
index
of
how
many
sidebands
are
generated
However
the
potential
applications
go
much
further
I
m
not
getting
a
whole
lot
of
complex
sounds
just
yet
but
this
is
just
the
start
said
Grodin
I
really
want
to
use
it
to
control
sample
rate
playback
so
you
could
actually
be
scratching
without
vinyl
The
possibilities
are
endless
because
you
re
getting
three
channels
of
raw
MIDI
data
and
that
s
something
you
can
do
anything
with
Myssse
a
visual
artist
who
bought
the
watch
to
capture
the
performance
of
drawing
as
data
figured
it
would
come
in
pretty
handy
at
Music
Hack
Day
He
was
right
When
I
came
here
of
course
there
are
like
five
new
ideas
everybody
gets
excited
and
we
re
figuring
out
brand
new
things
to
do
with
the
accelerometer
that
I
didn
t
consider
said
Mysse
That
sort
of
collaboration
between
like
minded
strangers
is
at
the
crux
of
this
event
It
would
cost
over
a
million
dollars
to
pay
all
of
these
developers
to
work
through
an
entire
weekend
instead
they
showed
up
because
by
teaming
with
other
hackers
with
complementary
skills
they
can
create
fairly
complex
stuff
like
this
at
breakneck
speed
Before
much
of
the
country
had
woken
up
on
Saturday
morning
they
built
a
gesture
controlled
music
system
We
want
it
to
be
flexible
but
provide
a
couple
of
patches
to
get
the
ball
rolling
so
someone
can
buy
the
watch
put
it
on
pair
it
with
their
computer
and
five
minutes
later
they
re
jamming
out
with
no
instruments
said
Mysse
The
current
codename
is
Toscanini
and
it
will
be
freeware
stated
Grodin
Mysse
Oh
we
have
a
codename

Album
Scout
Outdoes
iTunes
Genius
on
the
iPhone
Music
heads
have
a
new
way
to
connect
with
the
artists
they
love
on
iOS
devices
An
alternative
to
Apple
s
Genius
music
recommendation
software
Album
Scout
1
allows
users
to
discover
new
music
track
their
artists
and
share
what
they
find
with
their
friends
The
first
time
you
run
the
app
Album
Scout
automatically
grabs
information
from
your
iOS
device
s
library
and
instantly
provides
you
with
a
sleek
and
attractive
cover
flow
displaying
newly
released
albums
from
the
artists
in
your
collection
We
preferred
this
view
to
the
other
option
which
lets
you
slide
down
a
list
of
albums
Tap
any
album
to
listen
to
track
previews
and
see
how
popular
each
track
is
according
to
the
iTunes
store
If
you
like
what
you
hear
Album
Scout
can
connect
you
to
iTunes
so
your
shopping
spree
can
begin
Again
we
liked
the
cover
flow
version
best
but
one
advantage
exists
to
using
list
view
instead
a
Show
Greatest
Hits
filter
which
helps
deals
with
bands
like
Journey
that
tend
to
release
the
same
songs
in
multiple
collections
In
addition
to
the
new
releases
this
app
can
also
enhance
the
music
already
stored
on
your
iPhone
iPad
or
iPod
Touch
Tapping
Library
displays
your
iOS
device
s
music
collection
in
an
easy
to
navigate
format
including
biographies
a
list
of
similar
artists
and
the
artist
s
top
albums
all
from
Last
fm
Helpfully
you
can
choose
whether
or
not
to
scout
a
particular
artist
from
your
collection
or
scout
artists
you
like
even
if
their
music
isn
t
on
your
device
Whatever
you
find
you
can
share
with
friends
via
email
text
message
or
Twitter
from
within
the
app
The
functionality
of
Tunes
Genius
on
iOS
on
the
other
hand
is
limited
to
generating
playlists
from
music
stored
on
the
device
and
that
s
it
Album
Scout
developer
Matthew
Toohey
told
Evolver
fm
I
developed
Album
Scout
because
I
kept
realizing
good
albums
had
slipped
past
me
I
had
hoped
that
iTunes
Genius
would
be
good
for
this
purpose
but
I
found
it
was
very
hit
and
miss
It
kept
recommending
songs
from
the
past
that
I
had
already
decided
were
not
to
my
taste
good
apps
need
a
sharp
focus
and
so
I
chose
to
focus
only
on
the
discovery
of
new
music
That
way
you
can
stay
up
to
date
with
your
musical
tastes
with
Album
Scout
and
Genius
can
do
what
it
is
best
at
discovering
music
from
the
entire
catalog
We
had
fun
discovering
music
with
Album
Scout
a
great
app
for
fans
who
consistently
crave
for
new
music
For
1
you
can
start
scouting
too

Why
Lady
Gaga
Could
Deploy
a
Sound
Only
Your
Smartphone
Can
Hear
Updated
SonicLiving
hosts
demonstrations
of
how
it
can
embed
audio
tags
in
live
concerts
and
television
shows
on
its
website
link
below
Audio
tags
are
looking
more
and
more
like
the
new
QR
code
not
only
are
they
way
less
ugly
than
those
jagged
black
on
white
squares
but
you
don
t
need
to
take
a
picture
of
anything
in
order
for
them
to
work
See
also
Shazam
and
the
Super
Bowl
A
startup
called
SonicNotify
embeds
inaudibly
high
pitched
audio
signals
within
music
or
any
other
audio
track
When
a
compatible
app
hears
that
signal
it
triggers
any
available
smartphone
function
to
link
you
to
websites
display
text
bring
up
map
locations
display
a
photo
let
you
vote
on
which
song
a
performer
plays
next
and
so
on
SonicNotify
was
developed
with
help
from
Cantora
Records
Labs
which
made
its
name
by
funding
for
400
initially
and
releasing
the
band
MGMT
s
massively
popular
records
As
part
of
its
newly
minted
technology
division
Cantora
which
is
also
a
record
label
and
publishing
company
is
offering
25
000
to
100
000
to
promising
startups
among
the
first
of
which
is
SonicNotify
Lady
Gaga
could
have
used
its
technology
on
her
Monster
Ball
tour
Updated
Cantora
s
Jesse
Israel
specifically
mentioned
the
Monster
Ball
tour
see
below
but
was
using
the
example
hypothetically
Evolver
fm
regrets
the
error
and
Coachella
2013
and
other
events
are
next
in
line
To
interact
via
SonicNotify
fans
can
use
any
SonicNotify
enabled
app
If
you
want
to
see
it
in
action
now
you
can
do
so
with
the
official
Sonic
Experiences
app
An
inaudible
signal
triggers
an
option
to
vote
on
the
crowd
s
favorite
song
at
a
Coldplay
show
It
worked
even
through
our
tiny
laptop
speakers
SonicNotify
transmits
a
high
frequency
sound
wave
through
speakers
we
can
t
hear
the
frequency
but
smartphones
can
hear
it
so
we
re
able
to
unlock
content
at
live
events
TV
shows
and
through
the
web
said
Jesse
Israel
co
founder
of
Cantora
Records
Labs
a
record
label
at
NYC
Music
Tech
Meetup
We
ve
closed
deals
the
deal
is
not
done
Israel
now
says
the
company
is
working
with
with
Lady
Gaga
for
The
Monster
Ball
Tour
which
ran
from
2009
to
2011
we
re
doing
Coachella
we
re
doing
stuff
for
Fashion
Week
next
week
powering
32
stages
college
sports
partnerships
with
Twitter
and
Spotify
so
it
s
kind
of
a
cool
example
of
how
we
re
able
to
put
pieces
together
and
help
a
technology
get
off
the
ground
Buyers
and
journalists
with
the
app
installed
at
Fashion
Week
will
be
zapped
an
image
of
each
model
the
instant
they
step
onto
the
catwalk
so
they
can
examine
the
outfits
up
close
in
real
time
Similarly
impressive
capabilities
exist
within
the
music
realm
Best
of
all
the
audience
doesn
t
even
need
to
be
actively
running
the
app
in
order
for
it
to
pick
up
on
those
inaudible
signals
With
Sonic
we
can
unlock
anything
that
your
iPhone
or
Android
can
do
as
long
as
the
SonicNotify
SDK
is
built
into
an
app
that
s
running
in
the
background
on
your
phone
explained
Israel
For
example
some
of
the
stuff
we
re
doing
with
Gaga
is
when
she
is
performing
mid
set
everyone
in
the
arena
gets
a
notification
which
lets
them
choose
which
song
she
plays
for
her
encore
Location
is
also
a
part
of
this
because
each
speaker
in
a
venue
can
transmit
a
different
tone
opening
up
new
possibilities
for
live
concert
participation
along
the
lines
of
what
we
saw
with
inConcertApp
We
can
also
target
sections
through
radius
with
frequencies
so
we
can
have
Section
C
s
phones
turn
into
purple
hearts
while
Section
F
on
the
other
side
of
the
arena
has
red
squares
added
Israel
According
to
Israel
Cantora
s
basic
idea
is
that
app
developers
are
not
unlike
bands
in
that
they
might
have
all
the
skills
in
the
world
but
those
skills
don
t
amount
to
much
unless
they
are
properly
deployed
The
company
is
currently
working
with
SonicNotify
and
two
other
startups
and
it
plans
to
fund
8
to
10
in
total
over
the
next
two
years

Untapped
Apps
Round
Three
We
ve
chased
down
reviewed
analyzed
and
cataloged
thousands
of
music
apps
at
Evolver
fm
in
the
past
year
but
countless
ideas
remain
for
developers
to
build
and
for
the
rest
of
us
armchair
inventors
to
conceive
Our
Untapped

surveys
consist
of
music

ideas
from
the
wacky
to
the
wonderful
for
your
reading

We
saw
some
great
results
from
round
one
and
round
two
now
we
re
on
to
the
third
round
of
Untapped
Apps
To
put
things
in
perspective
music
apps
with
certain
exceptions
don
t
save
lives
unlike
this
plan
for
mapping
defibrillators
with
apps
Still
powerful
well
thought
out
pleasant
to
use
music
technologies
undoubtedly
raise
the
quality
of
our
lives
In
that
spirit
Evolver

surveys
are
designed
to
tease
out
some
of
these
next

ideas
Anyone
can
submit
an
idea
for
the
next
round
and
when
we
re
satisfied
with
the
list
it
goes

Obama
s
Spotify
Playlist
vs
Romney
s
Fictional
Playlist
The
official
Spotify
playlist
of
Barack
Obama
s
2012
campaign
It
s
our
world
politicians
just
live
in
it
Evolver
fm
has
a
long
history
of
posting
thematic
playlists
usually
with
Spotify
to
commemorate
everything
from
Hurricane
Irene
to
Occupy
Wall
Street
to
the
SOPA
PIPA
situation
a
tradition
that
technically
goes
back
to
a
collaborative
playlist
on
Wired
com
in
May
09
Is
someone
from
the
Obama
campaign
reading
about
music
apps
on
Evolver
fm
The
week
after
we
published
our
playlist
of
presidential
theme
songs
from
the
annals
of
history
reposted
by
Gizmodo
with
our
permission
natch
Obama
or
more
likely
one
of
his
people
announced
on
Twitter
the
availability
of
an
official
Barack
Obama
2012
Campaign
playlist
Obama
s
reelection
playlist
listen
here
features
not
one
but
two
songs
by
Darius
Rucker
That
is
not
what
concerns
us
now
as
concerning
as
it
is
that
arguably
the
most
powerful
person
in
the
world
listens
to
Hootie
What
s
more
impressive
is
the
way
Obama
s
people
have
embraced
social
music
This
playlist
was
created
about
three
hours
ago
and
it
already
has
1808
subscribers
within
Spotify
That
might
not
sound
like
a
lot
but
it
is
Plenty
of
people
don
t
know
what
Spotify
is
and
if
they
do
they
may
not
know
how
to
subscribe
to
a
playlist
As
younger
voters
grow
older
and
shareable
playlists
enter
the
mainstream
Spotify
and
other
media
sharing
sites
will
likely
become
a
new
political
battleground
We
wonder
how
long
it
will
take
until
Romney
Gingrich
and
the
rest
fire
back
If
they
don
t
people
might
be
tempted
to
make
those
playlists
for
them
oh
wait
Mitt
Romney
did
not
approve
this
message
but
someone
created
it
anyway
What
s
next
a
Turntable
fm
style
debate
replete
with
Awesome
and
Lame
buttons
We
wouldn
t
be
surprised

Pug
Life
Wacky
Scottish
Developers
Strike
Again
with
Dog
Based
Synthesizer
With
its
newly
released
Pug
Synth
Lucky
Frame
s
animated
pugs
build
on
their
nascent
reputation
as
the
most
musical
virtual
dogs
on
iOS
The
Scottish
development
team
s
latest
pug
themed
music
app
released
on
iTunes
on
Thursday
sees
the
return
of
the
pistachio
green
space
pugs
who
first
charmed
us
by
terraforming
planets
for
beat
generating
root
vegetables
i
e
beats
in
their
popular
Pugs
Luv
Beats
game
which
we
reviewed
in
all
its
weird
glory
Like
its
predecessor
Pug
Synth
sounds
surprisingly
good
for
a
cutesy
animated
iPhone
game
starring
costumed
dogs
It
expands
on
one
of
my
favorite
features
from
the
original
Pugs
Luv
Beats
a
touch
synthesizer
that
lets
you
solo
over
the
planet
menu
in
that
game
while
rifling
through
compositions
Essentially
an
X
Y
synthesizer
pad
in
disguise
an
instrument
you
may
already
be
familiar
with
Pug
Beats
features
tonal
parameters
animated
with
two
pugs
Pitch
and
envelope
are
controlled
by
your
finger
s
position
on
each
respective
axis
allowing
for
smooth
melodic
sweeps
through
scale
presets
as
you
swipe
across
the
screen
firing
at
floating
beats
which
look
like
beets
Each
time
you
play
a
note
a
stream
of
hearts
emanates
from
the
pugs
mouths
So
yeah
pretty
standard
synth
stuff
Pug
Synth
finds
even
more
unusual
ways
of
combining
gameplay
and
music
making
You
can
select
different
backing
loops
by
dressing
one
or
both
pugs
in
hats
The
free
app
comes
with
a
construction
helmet
and
shark
fin
with
more
hats
and
thus
more
loop
styles
available
for
a
buck
through
in
app
purchase
Tapping
the
snare
drum
icon
starts
or
stops
the
backing
loop
Meanwhile
dressing
the
pugs
in
different
costumes
of
course
alters
their
sound
by
cycling
through
synth
presets
Because
you
have
two
pugs
to
work
with
in
this
version
Pug
Synth
allows
for
polyphonic
duets
when
swiping
with
two
fingers
at
once
This
app
also
picks
up
where
Pugs
Luv
Beats
left
off
with
tonal
and
tempo
controls
allowing
users
to
alter
mode
chromatic
key
and
beats
per
minute
from
the
settings
menu
With
this
simple
app
Lucky
Frame
expands
on
what
it
did
best
in
Pugs
Luv
Beats
repackaging
an
intuitive
synthesizer
in
an
unintimidating
charming
user
friendly
interface
As
a
coworker
noted
the
pugs
could
really
be
anything
ninjas
came
to
mind
But
like
the
cheesed
off
birds
that
made
Rovio
s
Angry
Birds
such
a
classic
these
pugs
bring
a
flash
of
character
that
makes
this
weird
little
app
all
the
more
memorable

Android

Apple
AirPlay
Apple
s
AirPlay
gives
people
the
pleasure
of
watching
movies
looking
at
photos
and
of
course
listening
to
music
wirelessly
zapping
the
content
from
their
iPhones
iPod
Touches
or
iPads
to
their
televisions
and
home
speaker
systems
with
a
variety
of
popular
iOS
music
apps
What
about
Google
s
Android
devices
do
those
work
with
AirPlay
too
Last
year
Evolver
fm
reported
that
Apple
s
wireless
music
influence
was
in
fact
starting
to
be
felt
on
Android
Meanwhile
Google
s
competing
Fling
platform
has
effectively
been
a
non
starter
We
ve
since
seen
a
slow
but
steady
rise
in
Android
apps
that
stream
music
to
Apple
TV
Airport
Express
and
AirPlay
compatible
speakers
and
sound
systems
Google
should
be
worried
This
is
how
people
develop
a
taste
for
Apple
That
s
their
problem
To
help
Android
owners
who
want
in
on
wireless
home
music
without
waiting
for
Google
to
get
its
act
together
here
are
the
best
Android
apps
for
streaming
music
to
Apple
s
AirPlay
devices
Eye
C
Taglists
Taglists
by
Eye
C
The
first
Android
AirPlay
app
to
catch
our
attention
this
multi
platform
app
builds
on
Twitter
hash
tags
to
create
playlists
or
Taglists
out
of
music
on
YouTube
SoundCloud
and
elsewhere
and
share
them
on
your
social
networks
That
s
a
fairly
simple
and
ingenious
idea
but
we
mention
it
here
because
Eye
C
also
makes
it
easy
to
play
these
playlists
on
AirPlay
speakers
and
other
devices
Remote
For
iTunes
Apple
s
own
Remote
app
for
iPhone
and
iPad
is
popular
in
part
because
it
controls
music
on
computers
running
iTunes
and
can
extend
that
music
to
AirPlay
devices
too
all
without
music
fans
ever
touching
their
computers
Developer
Hyperfine
developed
an
Apple
Remote
counterpart
for
Android
and
Windows
Phone
that
does
pretty
much
the
same
thing
Using
its
sleek
black
layout
you
can
search
and
play
iTunes
music
on
a
computer
from
your
Android
Bonus
It
also
controls
volume
on
multiple
AirPlay
devices
individually
iMediaShare
iMediaShare
Lots
of
apps
can
stream
via
AirPlay
as
we
ve
seen
but
some
also
include
content
from
a
range
of
media
properties
built
right
in
Developer
Bianor
created
an
app
that
acts
sort
of
like
a
remote
control
that
s
also
the
cable
box
so
you
can
switch
between
between
online
channels
your
Android
s
music
library
and
other
media
services
and
stream
any
of
it
to
AirPlay
The
channel
surfing
interface
feels
like
the
iPhone
s
or
Android
s
graphical
list
of
app
icons
with
a
nice
selection
YouTube
The
Onion
CNN
Animal
Planet
etc
All
of
this
is
playable
on
a
long
list
of
hardware
thanks
to
DLNA
game
consoles
PlayStation3
XBox
360
televisions
Samsung
Sony
etc
audio
home
electronics
Sonos
Onkyo
etc
and
of
course
any
Airplay
enabled
device
It
s
a
monstrous
app
Twonky
PacketVideo
s
Twonky
comes
in
two
flavors
Twonky
Mobile
resembles
iMediaShare
in
that
it
s
an
all
inclusive
streaming
app
for
music
video
and
photos
to
lots
of
different
devices
but
with
a
different
look
and
feel
Then
there
s
Twonky
Music
which
works
as
a
conduit
for
your
Android
s
music
collection
or
your
favorite
web
radio
sources
to
any
AirPlay
or
DLNA
enabled
device
While
it
s
lighter
on
the
features
than
Twonky
Mobile
Twonky
Music
has
its
own
special
bonuses
the
Flipside
feature
is
one
of
the
tastiest
with
artist
information
biographies
lyrics
and
news
It
s
a
nice
feature
for
those
who
want
to
find
out
more
about
what
they
re
listening
to
without
switching
apps
AirBubble
Bubblesoft
s
offering
does
something
a
little
different
It
works
in
reverse
to
the
way
these
other
apps
work
Instead
of
sending
music
from
Android
to
AirPlay
devices
basically
acts
as
an
AirPlay
receiver
Connect
your
Android
to
some
speakers
fire
up
AirBubble
and
you
can
stream
from
iTunes
or
any
other
AirPlay
enabled
streamer
even
an
iPhone
to
your
sound
system
Honey
Player
As
its
developer
rich
high
puts
it
this
is
the
sweetest
player
for
Android
with
Airplay
It
s
exactly
that
nice
sweet
and
useful
This
simple
and
effective
music
player
streams
music
from
your
Android
s
music
library
to
any
AirPlay
device
without
a
lot
of
extra
bells
and
whistles
Its
classy
and
enjoyable
layout
lets
you
can
choose
some
music
pick
the
output
and
rate
your
music
with
ease
If
it
s
simple
you
re
after
you
just
found
it

Latest

Vincent
Morisset
bills
himself
as
a
web
friendly
director
which
is
a
fitting
distinction
Where
most
films
progress
in
a
linear
fashion
Morisset
takes
things
a
step
further
or
maybe
sideways
Through
simple
interactions
like
scrolling
a
mouse
across
a
computer
screen
or
complicated
ones
like
dancing
in
front
of
a
webcam
Morisset
s
films
ask
the
audience
to
participate
in
an
unfolding
narrative
His
approach
is
tailor
made
for
web
2
0
Just
as
Facebook
and
Twitter
are
only
worthwhile
when
users
get
involved
Morisset
s
work
truly
comes
alive
only
with
audience
input
Readers
may
know
Morisset
s
work
through
his
involvement
with
the
Grammy
winning
band
Arcade
Fire
with
whom
he
has
worked
since
their
2004
breakout
album
Funeral
Since
then
he
s
created
music
videos
interactive
web
content
and
the
2009
documentary
Mirroir
Noir
alongside
the
band
Most
recently
he
directed
the
beautifully
unsettling
video
for
The
Sprawl
II
Mountains
Beyond
Mountains
Arcade
Fire
s
latest
single
The
video
presents
characters
whose
behaviors
mimic
that
of
the
viewer
Dance
quickly
to
the
music
and
the
characters
will
do
the
same
slow
down
and
they
ll
follow
suit
If
you
stop
dancing
altogether
the
characters
stop
progressing
their
movements
stuck
in
an
endless
loop
Morisset
has
also
worked
with
Icelandic
post
rockers
Sigur
Ros
directing
that
band
s
concert
film
Inni
which
may
be
a
traditional
non
interactive
film
though
the
methods
of
its
creation
were
anything
but
He
shot
and
edited
the
movie
in
digital
HD
then
transferred
it
to
black
and
white
film
by
projecting
it
onto
a
screen
and
recording
that
projection
with
16mm
cameras
The
16mm
version
of
the
movie
was
then
itself
projected
as
Morisset
and
his
collaborators
improvised
manipulations
using
prisms
and
other
found
objects
Then
they
filmed
and
edited
that
version
using
digital
HD
equipment
The
result
was
uncanny
promotional
materials
accurately
describe
it
as
spare
and
near
monochromatic
in
its
tunnel
vision
inviting
both
intimacy
and
claustrophobia
We
recently
spoke
with
Morisset
about
the
ideas
behind
his
work
collaborating
with
musicians
and
his
complicated
relationship
with
technology
This
interview
has
been
edited
for
length
and
clarity
Andy
Cush
Evolver

I
wanted
to
start
by
asking
you
about
your
background
especially
the
interactive
side
of
your
art
How
did
you
come
to
work
in
this
particular
format
Vincent
Morisset
Director
When
I
was
younger
I
wanted
to
go
into
cinema
so
I
went
to
school
in
that
direction
When
I
was
in
university
I
was
in
this
communication
program
You
had
to
decide
whether
to
go
into
TV
cinema
or
radio
The
year
I
had
to
choose
my
profile
they
opened
up
this
new
program
called
multimedia
and
it
just
fit
with
my
personality
I
m
a
guy
who
can
touch
every
aspect
of
it
and
so
I
jumped
in
that
program
This
was
in
the
late
90s
so
my
path
kind
of
changed
at
that
point
For
a
couple
of
years
I
d
been
mainly
developing
graphic
based
websites
because
at
that
time
that
was
the
limitation
of
the
medium
In
the
beginning
of
the
00s
the
bandwidth
allowed
us
to
play
more
and
more
with
video
so
at
that
point
my
two
loves
if
I
may
say
joined
back
together
I
started
to
do
more
and
more
video
based
projects
I
was
part
of
a
team
with
other
people
and
I
was
the
guy
that
was
more
comfortable
with
technology
I
don
t
consider
myself
a
geek
I
don
t
love
programming
but
I
learned
how
to
code
in
Lingo
and
in
ActionScript
to
make
projects
happen
So
I
have
this
kind
of
self
taught
programming
background
but
at
the
same
time
I
studied
cinema
At
some
point
those
two
backgrounds
collided
and
I
started
doing
what
we
now
call
interactive
video
Evolver
fm
Do
you
see
the
technology
as
worth
pursuing
on
it
s
own
making
something
with
the
most
high
tech
tools
available
Or
is
it
more
of
a
means
to
achieve
an
artistic
vision
Morisset
I
m
not
a
geek
I
m
not
really
excited
about
the
technology
for
its
own
sake
I
think
it
offers
amazing
possibilities
but
I
m
not
one
of
those
guys
who
get
excited
just
because
of
it
Ideas
always
drive
my
projects
and
I
use
the
tools
that
are
around
me
to
achieve
them
I
think
it
s
important
that
we
understand
the
possibilities
and
the
limitations
of
those
tools
but
for
me
it
s
important
that
the
projects
are
driven
by
ideas
so
that
they
don
t
become
technology
demos
or
whatever
Evolver
fm
A
lot
of
your
work
though
technologically
impressive
manages
to
feel
very
handmade
and
human
the
animations
in
the
interactive
film
Bla
Bla
for
instance
or
the
homespun
quality
of
this
newest
Arcade
Fire
video
Sprawl
II
Morisset
Thanks
I
think
there
s
a
paradox
about
my
relationship
with
technology
In
a
way
I
love
it
One
of
my
mottos
is
The
web
is
fun
I
love
this
platform
I
love
this
medium
but
the
way
we
connect
with
images
on
our
laptop
is
really
different
from
the
way
we
relate
to
images
on
a
TV
screen
Since
I
want
to
trigger
emotions
through
my
projects
I
work
hard
so
that
we
kind
of
forget
that
we
re
in
front
of
a
computer
We
forget
about
the
technology
and
it
just
feels
like
a
kind
of
weird
magical
thing
reacting
to
what
you
do
Evolver
fm
Would
you
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
Sprawl
II
video
your
processes
behind
it
and
how
it
came
to
be
Morisset
I
ve
been
working
with
the
band
forever
back
since
Funeral
so
we
have
this
ongoing
creative
collaboration
going
on
When
they
were
recording
The
Suburbs
I
was
working
as
artistic
director
on
the
whole
visual
aspect
of
the
artwork
juggling
different
ideas
for
various
projects
For
a
while
I
wanted
to
develop
an
interactive
video
project
that
would
be
free
of
any
interface
just
this
thing
that
s
really
spontaneous
and
primitive
I
showed
this
really
basic
little
demo
to
Regine
Chassagne
Arcade
Fire
s
singer
multi
instrumentalist
where
you
just
waved
your
hand
at
the
webcam
and
it
triggered
sounds
and
flickered
the
screen
She
said
she
thought
they
d
have
a
song
that
was
a
little
more
pop
the
kind
of
song
you
could
dance
to
and
that
she
d
play
it
for
me
when
it
was
done
At
the
end
it
ended
up
being
The
Sprawl
II
It
was
kind
of
disco
ish
and
for
me
it
fit
perfectly
with
the
concept
So
time
passed
I
worked
on
other
projects
and
at
the
end
of
the
album
cycle
I
was
like
Hey
we
should
really
do
this
The
band
was
totally
into
doing
a
dance
activated
video
but
they
wanted
to
make
sure
people
without
a
webcam
or
a
good
computer
would
still
be
able
to
have
a
sense
of
the
world
we
were
creating
so
we
decided
to
do
a
kind
of
hybrid
project
We
would
have
a
traditional
film
that
could
be
seen
on
YouTube
or
on
TV
and
parallel
to
that
would
be
this
interactive
video
That
was
kind
of
a
challenge
because
out
of
the
same
shoot
I
had
to
do
two
parallel
projects
for
two
totally
different
mediums
Evolver
fm
Thematically
the
album
seems
conflicted
about
the
state
of
modern
life
as
we
know
it
and
your
video
dovetails
nicely
with
that
You
created
these
images
that
at
times
almost
feel
like
home
video
and
presented
them
in
a
new
confusing
context
A
still
from
Morisset
s
interactive
video
for
The
Sprawl
II
Morisset
We
wanted
to
have
something
that
would
be
really
simple
and
straightforward
but
not
boring
So
we
asked
ourselves
what
we
like
about
music
videos
and
decided
to
make
something
that
felt
spontaneous
and
fun
with
a
bit
of
strangeness
added
It
s
always
funny
when
I
first
show
the
project
to
different
kinds
of
people
When
they
start
to
understand
the
cause
and
effect
of
their
gestures
and
the
echo
in
the
choreography
there
s
this
moment
when
they
re
like
Whoa
They
get
a
bit
freaked
out
And
then
when
you
pass
this
moment
you
kind
of
assimilate
it
and
make
the
video
your
own
It
s
funny
how
different
people
interact
with
it
depending
on
their
personality
or
their
cultural
background
Some
people
are
more
analytical
about
it
some
people
just
let
loose
It
s
funny
to
see
how
people
connect
with
a
piece
like
that
Evolver
fm
The
interactivity
makes
it
just
as
much
about
whatever
baggage
you
re
bringing
to
the
table
as
a
spectator
as
it
is
about
what
the
artist
put
into
it
Morisset
It
also
connects
to
what
the
song
is
about
There
s
this
character
alienated
by
her
environment
who
wants
to
get
loose
and
escape
from
that
alienating
environment
The
fact
that
you
dance
in
front
of
your
computer
is
also
a
bit
liberating
and
kind
of
weird
because
you
re
not
in
a
context
where
you
normally
dance
You
re
at
your
work
computer
or
in
your
living
room
and
there
s
this
moment
where
you
cross
a
tiny
boundary
Evolver
fm
One
of
the
criticisms
you
often
hear
about
internet
culture
is
that
it
causes
people
to
have
short
attention
spans
about
the
media
they
consume
Because
your
interactive
work
is
mostly
experienced
online
by
its
nature
there
s
a
good
chance
some
people
won
t
give
it
their
full
attention
and
others
will
perceive
it
as
frivolous
Does
that
bother
you
at
all
Morisset
No
not
at
all
I
like
this
gray
area
about
music
video
culture
There
s
something
really
exciting
about
that
niche
because
you
re
juggling
between
two
worlds
You
connect
to
a
broad
audience
but
you
re
able
to
propose
things
that
are
unusual
and
sometimes
a
bit
challenging
It
s
okay
if
people
see
it
one
way
or
another
It
s
part
of
the
process
part
of
the
game
I
quite
like
the
fact
that
we
are
able
to
reach
all
kinds
of
people
and
present
it
in
different
contexts
At
some
point
you
don
t
have
control
over
what
contexts
the
piece
will
be
re
presented
in
so
you
don
t
know
how
people
will
look
at
it
And
I
think
that
s
kind
of
cool
Evolver
fm
Yeah
that
must
be
pretty
exciting
Just
releasing
it
into
the
wild
Morisset
You
need
to
embrace
that
It
s
part
of
what
the
web
is
Evolver
fm
There
seems
to
be
a
connection
with
music
in
a
lot
of
your
work
even
the
stuff
that
isn
t
commissioned
by
a
band
When
you
began
your
career
as
an
artist
did
you
know
that
you
d
have
this
close
relationship
with
music
Or
is
that
something
that
evolved
on
its
own
Morisset
Your
life
is
about
accidents
happy
accidents
The
fact
that
I
started
to
work
with
Arcade
Fire
something
like
eight
years
ago
it
led
me
to
doing
projects
that
bounced
into
other
projects
and
other
projects
and
other
people
asking
me
to
work
with
them
In
the
last
years
I
ve
just
been
lucky
enough
to
work
with
amazing
artists
I
would
say
it
s
been
this
kind
of
theory
of
encounters
I
didn
t
look
to
do
just
music
related
projects
it
just
kind
of
happened
like
that
And
I
must
say
I
decided
that
in
the
next
year
I
d
like
to
explore
other
things
But
I
love
music
and
I
think
there
s
a
strong
connection
between
music
and
image
especially
for
interactive
stuff
When
you
re
playing
with
non
linear
editing
the
music
gives
the
thing
a
kind
of
emotional
spine
It
gives
it
a
structure
Even
if
you
re
playing
with
something
that
s
really
reactive
at
least
you
have
this
backbone
to
keep
the
tension
and
dramatic
crescendos
of
a
piece
So
it
s
something
really
useful
for
me
as
an
artist
working
with
interactive
material
but
I
don
t
way
to
be
pigeonholed
to
do
music
stuff
Like
I
said
before
I
like
to
touch
all
kinds
of
things
Evolver
fm
Something
that
attracted
me
to
Inni
was
the
hands
on
analog
manipulation
of
the
film
that
you
guys
were
doing
You
re
taking
something
that
was
originally
filmed
digitally
in
HD
and
working
with
it
like
you
would
with
clay
or
paint
as
a
physical
artistic
object
Could
you
explain
that
process
Morisset
I
see
that
as
a
traditional
film
It
s
linear
and
about
an
hour
long
but
I
took
a
lot
of
the
expertise
that
I
developed
with
web
projects
into
that
process
I
m
always
trying
to
destroy
the
slick
perfect
a
bit
soulless
look
of
computer
ish
imagery
In
Bla
Bla
it
was
the
same
I
did
some
old
school
stop
motion
with
a
puppet
then
rotoscoped
the
face
in
3D
so
that
I
could
map
the
mouth
and
the
eyes
in
real
time
So
again
I
was
working
with
something
that
was
really
fragile
and
imperfect
but
using
sophisticated
technology
along
with
it
With
Inni
it
s
kind
of
the
other
way
around
We
took
advantage
of
these
really
light
sensitive
cameras
and
were
able
to
edit
the
film
in
a
straightforward
efficient
way
But
there
was
this
too
crisp
feel
to
it
it
was
almost
like
watching
the
news
on
TV
It
kind
of
killed
all
the
magic
and
the
aura
of
what
Sigur
Ros
is
So
I
thought
we
d
try
a
more
spontaneous
approach
with
the
post
production
When
I
pitched
the
idea
to
Sigur
Ros
I
was
comparing
it
to
when
Neil
Young
did
the
Dead
Man
soundtrack
He
sat
in
front
of
the
Jim
Jarmusch
film
with
his
guitar
looking
at
it
for
the
first
time
and
just
jammed
over
it
There
s
this
really
volatile
imperfect
thing
about
it
that
makes
it
so
alive
and
beautiful
Again
computers
can
do
amazing
things
but
there
s
something
about
organic
handmade
stuff
You
can
t
fake
it
You
just
need
to
put
your
hands
in
the
dirt
and
do
it
Evolver
fm
Tell
me
about
your
synchronized
artwork
for
The
Suburbs
Morisset
Well
I
think
there
s
a
lot
of
potential
in
this
really
straightforward
way
of
presenting
digital
content
synchronized
with
the
song
It
struck
me
that
more
people
haven
t
embraced
this
path
I
was
like
damn
I
thought
it
was
such
a
cool
idea
Why
aren
t
other
people
doing
it
It
s
kind
of
a
no
brainer
It
makes
no
sense
that
in
2012
we
re
still
stuck
with
a
JPEG
for
the
whole
album
It
s
bizarre
It
s
been
blocked
by
Apple
in
a
way
It
couldn
t
be
sold
in
their
store
because
it
s
not
standard
MP3s
but
it
s
not
exactly
an
app
either
Evolver
fm
It
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
Bj
rk
s
Biophilia
suite
of
apps
Obviously
they
re
very
different
but
they
seem
of
a
piece
in
a
way
because
both
are
looking
at
the
album
format
and
asking
what
could
we
be
doing
differently
in
2012
Morisset
With
the
Bj
rk
thing
you
need
to
get
into
the
app
to
listen
to
the
song
You
re
kind
of
forced
to
be
involved
in
it
For
me
listening
to
music
is
something
that
can
go
both
ways
I
can
remember
sitting
on
the
couch
when
I
was
younger
and
opening
the
vinyl
sleeve
and
reading
the
lyrics
But
when
I
m
on
the
bus
I
don
t
want
to
have
to
hold
the
record
sleeve
I
want
to
put
it
on
sleep
put
it
in
my
pocket
and
still
be
able
to
listen
to
it
I
still
want
to
put
it
on
random
with
other
songs
I
still
want
to
be
able
to
put
those
tracks
in
a
playlist
The
Bj
rk
thing
is
cool
in
itself
but
I
would
love
it
if
it
could
be
embedded
in
your
listening
environment
If
you
re
in
that
you
can
t
do
anything
else
If
you
listen
to
the
app
album
you
re
in
that
so
you
have
your
virtual
booklet
open
at
all
times
Evolver
fm
Have
you
seen
any
interactive
work
for
bands
that
other
people
are
doing
that
inspires
you
Morisset
It
s
not
interactive
but
I
do
like
Radio
Soulwax
It
s
a
set
of
mixtapes
with
evolving
artwork
Evolver
fm
Is
there
anything
happening
in
the
world
of
more
mainstream
narrative
film
that
s
got
you
excited
Is
that
a
world
that
you
would
ever
consider
trying
to
work
in
Morisset
I
m
embracing
traditional
linear
films
I
ve
done
two
films
so
it
s
not
a
world
I
m
totally
unfamiliar
with
One
thing
I
think
is
exciting
is
how
those
films
get
around
now
I
think
we
re
on
the
verge
of
changing
distribution
and
how
we
consume
films
so
films
that
are
a
bit
more
niche
are
able
to
reach
an
audience
more
easily
I
think
Mirroir
Noir
the
Arcade
Fire
documentary
was
one
of
the
first
feature
films
to
be
originally
distributed
online
When
it
first
came
out
the
only
way
you
could
see
it
was
to
buy
it
online
and
download
the
HD
video
It
was
a
bit
peculiar
no
film
festivals
no
theater
screenings
At
the
end
I
think
it
was
successful
because
we
were
able
to
reach
in
a
single
day
the
whole
fan
community
And
people
just
wanted
to
see
that
film
I
think
if
we
had
gone
down
the
traditional
path
people
would
have
found
a
torrent
of
it
not
because
they
wanted
to
pirate
they
just
wanted
to
see
it
so
badly
So
in
a
way
we
short
circuited
the
threat
and
in
a
way
that
was
good
After
that
the
film
got
screened
at
some
theaters
and
some
film
events
So
the
film
s
life
was
inverted
but
in
a
good
way

Daniel

CEO

I

throat
right
now
if
you
re
asking
about
me
personally
but
Spotify
is
doing
fantastic
That
s

Can
you
give
us
a
preview
of
what
you
intend
to
discuss
at
the
GRAMMY
Foundation
s
Entertainment
Law
Initiative
Luncheon
Ek
There
s
a
lot
of
interesting
debate
going
on
now
about
streaming
and
I
like
that
it
s
become
more
about
streaming
and
not
what
s
free
or
not
But
what
I
really
want
to
talk
about
is
the
future
We
have
this
debate
about
where
it
is
right
now
but
I
still
think
streaming
is
really
in
its
infancy
and
I
want
to
outline
the
future
of
what
that
looks
like
what
it
will
actually
mean
for
the
music
industry
What
would
it
mean
for
how
to
promote
an
act
Or
for
revenues
We
re
at
a
time
now
when
more
and
more
people
are
saying
Hey
actually
this
is
working
and
we
ve
got
two
and
a
half
million
paying
customers
and
that
number
is
growing
very
very
quickly
and
it
keeps
accelerating
Personally
speaking
I
am
more
bullish
on
the
future
of
the
music
industry
than
ever
before
and
I
think
we
re
kind
of
entering
a
golden
age
in
music
Evolver
fm
What
will
that
golden
age
look
like
Spotify
gets
political
as
Barack
Obama
s
reelection
campaigners
posted
a
Spotify
playlist
featuring
their
favorite
songs
including
some
of
the
president
s
Ek
First
I
think
we
re
talking
about
a
world
where
I
believe
most
of
it
will
be
access
There
will
be
ownership
as
well
I
think
the
total
amount
of
revenues
back
to
the
industry
is
going
to
grow
We
ve
paid
over
200
million
to
rightsholders
already
and
it
s
still
in
the
early
days
So
for
me
part
of
it
is
talking
about
the
growth
story
of
how
we
get
the
music
industry
back
to
where
it
used
to
be
and
probably
even
past
that
The
second
part
is
in
a
world
where
music
is
really
about
you
listening
to
music
and
your
friends
discovering
it
from
you
what
does
that
mean
about
how
we
break
acts
and
promote
acts
Spotify
up
until
now
hasn
t
really
done
a
great
job
of
helping
that
but
you
re
going
to
see
us
doing
more
and
more
to
break
acts
and
try
to
really
promote
them
as
well
Looking
at
Spotify
today
and
fast
forwarding
three
years
to
2015
Where
s
the
music
industry
Where
s
Spotify
and
what
does
this
mean
to
a
band
manager
or
label
I
think
it
s
exciting
times
Creating
a
record
is
really
about
three
core
components
The
first
thing
is
creating
the
actual
record
It
used
to
be
really
expensive
to
do
that
and
now
really
anyone
can
record
a
record
even
in
their
own
homes
The
second
piece
is
that
it
used
to
be
really
expensive
distributing
the
record
and
now
with
iTunes
Spotify
and
other
services
distributing
another
digital
copy
basically
doesn
t
cost
anything
But
the
funny
thing
is
marketing
used
to
be
kind
of
simple
in
the
old
days
You
used
to
be
able
to
just
put
it
on
the
radio
or
MTV
and
it
just
worked
If
it
was
a
good
song
the
record
started
selling
based
on
that
Today
the
media
landscape
is
much
more
fragmented
MTV
s
not
about
music
anymore
and
radio
is
even
hard
er
to
break
through
There
are
tons
of
radio
channels
and
most
of
them
play
stuff
people
already
know
So
marketing
an
act
today
is
really
really
really
expensive
If
it
went
from
being
a
broadcast
medium
of
just
getting
it
out
there
to
everyone
to
a
social
medium
where
music
is
discovered
through
friends
what
does
that
mean
for
the
marketing
of
music
I
think
that
s
another
core
component
of
getting
this
to
work
Evolver
fm
That
s
a
really
good
point
I
guess
we
re
also
seeing
that
with
some
of
the
audio
ads
within
Spotify
which
are
clips
of
songs
Ek
Hopefully
I
ll
also
be
able
to
go
into
some
interesting
things
we
ve
seen
during
my
address
especially
with
Facebook
where
there
are
acts
like
Foster
The
People
who
kind
of
blew
up
on
the
service
really
because
friends
started
discovering
them
from
other
people
That
s
a
great
story
for
us
to
show
Look
this
works
People
discovered
it
not
just
through
radio
where
they
didn
t
have
much
promotion
but
because
friends
kept
recommending
and
listening
to
it
so
their
friends
in
turn
discovered
it
Evolver
fm
Is
that
part
of
the
decision
to
require
a
Facebook
login
on
Spotify
because
you
see
the
social
sharing
as
so
important
Ek
We
look
at
the
sharing
of
music
as
really
really
important
for
our
business
We
ve
found
that
the
more
social
our
users
are
i
e
they
re
sharing
music
the
faster
they
grow
their
own
music
library
And
the
faster
they
grow
their
music
library
the
faster
they
become
paying
customers
That
s
really
the
rationale
for
us
not
really
the
marketing
side
but
we
feel
that
the
combination
of
Facebook
and
Spotify
is
a
positive
thing
Evolver
fm
I
remember
when
we
first
met
in
New
York
years
ago
and
you
said
that
you
wanted
to
create
a
legal
version
of
the
sort
of
experience
that
people
have
in
the
P2P
version
My
favorite
thing
about
Napster
was
searching
for
one
rare
band
that
I
loved
If
someone
had
that
then
I
trusted
them
and
knew
that
I
was
going
to
like
anything
else
they
had
Ek
Yep
Evolver
fm
It
seems
like
you
have
succeeded
in
translating
that
to
a
legal
music
service
so
congratulations
on
that
Ek
Yes
we
ve
done
that
Right
now
it
s
skewed
more
toward
your
friends
What
we
want
to
make
it
skew
toward
is
you
discovering
other
people
with
great
music
taste
as
well
Evolver
fm
Are
there
any
misunderstandings
about
Spotify
that
you
d
like
to
clear
up
Ek
I
feel
to
an
extent
that
we
re
a
victim
of
our
own
success
What
I
mean
by
that
is
especially
if
you
look
at
the
media
Spotify
is
seen
as
this
gigantic
company
the
size
of
Apple
s
iTunes
which
is
not
really
true
We
re
really
starting
up
here
and
that
s
how
we
feel
about
it
If
you
look
at
a
country
like
the
U
S
there
s
sub
1
percent
of
the
population
that
s
even
using
any
legal
streaming
service
I
think
that
sometimes
people
perceive
us
as
being
a
lot
larger
than
we
are
and
that
s
an
important
point
to
make
Spotify

Another
point
I
want
to
make
is
that
this
is
a
very
very
different
model
than
just
selling
a
record
Everyone
talks
about
volume
and
what
this
means
in
terms
of
numbers
and
I
don
t
think
it
s
comparable
In
the
world
today
there
are
500
million
people
listening
to
music
online
Out
of
them
there
s
only
a
very
small
portion
who
are
avid
iTunes
customers
which
we
look
at
today
as
being
the
majority
of
the
digital
music
ecosystem
So
the
way
we
re
approaching
this
is
we
want
to
reach
the
500
million
people
of
whom
the
vast
majority
aren
t
really
using
iTunes
I
d
also
like
to
address
people
who
think
they
ll
gain
sales
by
not
being
on
Spotify
There
s
not
a
shred
of
data
to
suggest
that
In
fact
all
the
information
available
points
to
streaming
services
helping
to
drive
sales
Album
unit
sales
were
up
in
the
U
S
in
2011
the
year
Spotify
launched
for
the
first
time
since
2004
More
than
a
dozen
albums
which
debuted
at
number
one
have
been
available
on
Spotify
at
launch
Spotify
users
are
the
exact
same
people
who
used
to
listen
to
music
every
day
on
YouTube
whose
entire
music
collection
was
pulled
off
BitTorrent
sites
By
offering
them
a
compelling
music
service
that
allows
them
to
discover
hundreds
of
new
artists
not
just
their
favorites
pulled
from
YouTube
or
pirated
we
re
seeing
millions
move
back
to
listening
to
music
legally
after
years
of
being
left
out
in
the
cold
They
re
helping
pay
a
ton
of
money
back
to
the
industry
You
re
talking
10
million
active
users
2
5
million
subscribers
most
of
them
paying
120
a
year
which
is
double
the
amount
of
your
average
iTunes
user
Do
you
really
want
to
hold
back
your
album
from
people
who
are
finally
paying
for
music
again
If
you
think
that
by
doing
so
you
re
getting
them
to
buy
your
album
on
a
CD
or
as
an
album
download
again
there
s
absolutely
no
evidence
to
back
that
theory
up
Your
album
s
getting
shared
en
masse
over
BitTorrent
over
YouTube
It
s
there
right
now
but
you
decide
that
it
s
the
paying
loyal
music
fans
that
should
lose
out
It
makes
no
sense
Another
thing
I
want
to
mention
When
someone
creates
a
Spotify
playlist
and
they
put
an
album
or
songs
in
there
they
don
t
just
play
them
once
What
actually
happens
is
they
keep
repeatedly
playing
them
What
I
think
is
interesting
and
what
we
do
here
is
that
the
sales
cycle
of
that
record
is
anywhere
from
four
to
12
weeks
in
most
typical
cases
With
Spotify
we
keep
seeing
the
effect
up
to
25
35
weeks
or
even
a
year
So
when
looking
at
the
effect
a
certain
record
release
has
one
in
the
world
of
Spotify
has
to
look
not
just
at
the
first
12
weeks
but
actually
look
at
six
months
and
probably
even
a
year
after
because
it
keeps
playing
And
every
time
someone
plays
a
song
we
pay
the
music
industry
I
think
that
is
probably
the
biggest
misunderstanding
everyone
keeps
comparing
an
apple
to
what
s
actually
not
an
apple
but
hopefully
a
tastier
fruit
Evolver
fm
It
seems
like
that
would
give
musicians
an
incentive
to
make
music
that
people
want
to
listen
to
over
and
over
again
which
could
be
good
culturally
It
s
not
just
about
making
a
splash
Ek
Yeah
At
Spotify
we
really
want
you
to
democratically
win
as
a
musician
We
want
you
to
win
because
your
music
is
the
best
music
And
the
only
way
you
can
win
in
the
Spotify
ecosystem
unless
you
buy
advertising
is
by
friends
recommending
you
to
other
friends
And
they
do
so
by
listening
to
your
music
They
vote
with
their
hands
and
feet
I
think
that
s
a
pretty
great
thing
for
an
artist
that
s
creating
great
music
What
s
interesting
to
me
looking
at
the
greatest
acts
of
last
year
is
that
many
of
those
acts
are
acts
that
five
or
10
years
ago
may
not
have
even
had
a
record
deal
but
they
ve
grown
like
one
of
my
favorite
bands
Mumford
Sons
I
don
t
know
how
much
they
ve
been
growing
on
social
networks
but
I
can
tell
you
the
reason
why
I
discovered
them
was
someone
actually
sent
me
a
YouTube
clip
and
then
I
started
searching
for
them
on
Spotify
and
I
discovered
this
fantastic
band
I
guess
the
point
is
that
in
the
future
we
re
getting
more
and
more
connected
all
over
the
world
and
hopefully
that
will
mean
that
great
music
will
prevail
because
your
friends
will
listen
to
it
and
share
it
with
other
friends
Spotify
can
send
music
via
Apple
AirPlay
to
home
stereos
and
other
devices
Evolver
fm
The
two
big
areas
for
growth
in
digital
music
seem
to
be
the
car
and
the
television
What
can
you
tell
us
about
Spotify
s
strategy
there
Ek
Much
like
we
believe
a
strength
of
the
CD
was
being
ubiquitous
that
you
can
take
a
CD
and
put
it
in
any
player
and
just
press
play
that
s
how
easy
we
want
it
to
be
to
play
music
with
Spotify
As
more
and
more
devices
are
getting
connected
the
base
of
people
who
will
want
to
listen
to
music
with
those
devices
will
increase
and
that
s
something
we
re
hugely
excited
about
Evolver
fm
To
switch
gears
for
a
second
I
was
very
interested
to
cover
what
Spotify
is
doing
with
apps
You
can
build
desktop
apps
on
Spotify
s
catalog
iOS
apps
and
now
you
can
build
apps
within
the
Spotify
desktop
client
How
significant
do
you
see
that
ecosystem
Is
it
going
to
be
a
major
part
of
Spotify
s
growth
in
the
future
Ek
Yeah
we
definitely
do
believe
that
There
are
multiple
ways
one
can
look
at
this
but
what
we
re
trying
to
primarily
address
is
that
when
it
comes
to
music
we
ve
got
15
or
16
million
tracks
I
don
t
even
know
what
the
exact
number
is
but
there
s
an
endless
amount
of
music
You
could
listen
your
whole
life
to
the
Spotify
catalog
and
you
probably
wouldn
t
get
through
a
third
of
it
What
s
needed
on
top
of
that
is
curated
experiences
Part
of
that
curated
experience
is
people
building
playlists
and
sharing
those
playlists
with
their
friends
But
another
part
is
trusted
sources
people
who
tend
to
be
really
really
good
at
music
There
are
things
you
can
offer
with
music
that
aren
t
Spotify
s
core
competencies
like
lyrics
ticketing
and
other
things
We
felt
that
the
Internet
really
was
silent
and
that
music
was
missing
We
wanted
to
create
a
platform
to
allow
people
to
interact
with
music
whether
that
s
providing
curation
or
providing
more
interesting
experiences
or
even
using
that
to
give
you
other
venues
such
as
ticketing
and
merchandising
We
think
all
of
those
things
are
super
exciting
but
they
re
not
our
core
competency
We
might
have
100
or
150
engineers
and
that
s
great
but
already
now
with
the
Spotify
platform
we
ve
got
thousands
of
engineers
working
on
creating
more
interesting
music
experiences
And
that
s
ultimately
really
good
for
the
music
industry
because
there
are
more
avenues
now
to
listen
to
music
and
interact
with
music
Ultimately
that
s
going
to
make
more
people
care
about
music
and
pay
for
it
again

We
ve
talked
a
little
bit
about
the
royalty
payouts
Some
people
have
said
from
time
to
time
that
the
payouts
are
too
low
and
others
point
out
that
with
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
changing
hands
how
can
that
be
low
A
few
artists
are
deciding
not
to
have
releases
on
Spotify
so
I
guess
one
conclusion
to
draw
would
be
that
it
s
too
difficult
to
do
freemium
streaming
to
pay
what
seem
like
very
high
royalties
in
one
sense
but
on
a
per
artist
level
some
people
say
it
s
not
very
much
How
do
you
see
this
playing
out
Ek
As
I
said
a
lot
of
people
try
to
compare
an
apple
to
another
fruit
and
as
I
started
out
saying
we
look
at
it
as
us
being
in
our
infancy
We
haven
t
even
started
really
We
re
still
a
really
young
company
So
ultimately
our
view
is
that
the
royalty
checks
we
re
paying
out
now
of
course
we
re
happy
that
there
s
progress
being
made
but
it
s
still
only
in
its
early
days
and
it
will
keep
growing
Last
year
was
a
great
testament
to
that
when
in
May
we
hit
a
million
paying
customers
and
at
the
end
of
that
year
we
were
at
two
and
a
half
million
That
s
a
significant
increase
in
customers
who
are
paying
100
bucks
a
year
And
Spotify
keeps
growing
at
that
pace
if
not
faster
So
I
think
the
royalty
checks
as
they
re
combined
will
definitely
grow
But
I
also
want
to
kind
of
caution
people
We
get
a
lot
of
media
attention
People
think
we
re
actively
seeking
that
media
attention
and
in
most
instances
we
re
not
People
just
like
the
product
so
much
that
they
like
to
write
about
it
I
find
this
when
I
meet
artists
They
actually
think
we
re
a
lot
larger
than
we
are
I
say
Look
we
re
not
really
We
re
roughly
10
million
users
in
countries
where
in
total
there
are
600
million
people
And
out
of
them
at
least
250
million
are
listening
to
music
online
so
we
re
actually
a
very
small
part
of
this
right
now
I
want
to
add
that
my
home
country
Sweden
where
Spotify
has
grown
to
scale
if
you
look
at
the
artists
now
the
vast
majority
of
the
artists
are
getting
between
50
and
60
percent
of
all
their
income
from
Spotify
And
I
think
that
s
what
s
going
to
happen
when
this
model
gets
to
scale
And
the
music
industry
in
Sweden
is
growing
Evolver
fm
The
latest
thing
with
Spotify
and
Facebook
is
this
ability
to
listen
to
the
same
thing
at
the
same
time
which
I
think
is
a
fantastic
feature
It
makes
music
not
only
something
between
a
person
an
MP3
player
and
a
pair
of
headphones
Over
the
long
term
is
this
going
to
become
a
mainstream
activity
or
is
it
just
for
people
like
me
who
use
the
latest
stuff
and
get
a
kick
out
of
it
Ek
Our
approach
is
that
we
don
t
know
With
that
said
we
think
music
is
the
most
social
thing
there
is
and
we
think
people
want
to
interact
with
music
The
background
on
that
feature
is
that
it
was
actually
built
by
Facebook
which
we
think
is
cool
One
of
the
engineers
there
showed
it
to
me
one
time
when
I
came
to
visit
and
he
was
like
What
do
you
think
about
this
I
said
This
is
awesome
you
should
just
release
it
The
coolest
thing
is
that
he
could
build
that
feature
because
Spotify
is
a
platform
so
he
could
interact
with
our
APIs
create
it
and
put
it
on
the
Facebook
service
We
didn
t
actually
interact
that
much
to
get
this
done
but
it
was
one
of
the
things
that
the
Facebook
folks
were
really
passionate
about
and
I
think
I
hope
and
I
believe
that
there
will
be
10
other
projects
similar
to
this
around
the
Web
right
now
where
people
build
cool
interesting
experiences
Two
weeks
ago
someone
who
created
the
Spotify
app
Soundrop
released
their
own
iOS
app
So
now
all
of
a
sudden
I
have
a
room
where
I
m
walking
around
and
people
talk
about
music
where
they
vote
for
which
track
will
come
next
It
s
kind
of
a
social
radio
And
that
was
built
by
two
guys
in
Oslo
I
guess
the
answer
is
that
we
don
t
know
what
will
work
or
not
but
we
re
thrilled
that
people
want
to
innovate
around
it
Evolver
fm
So
do
you
still
find
time
to
play
guitar
Ek
Laughs
I
do
I
actually
bought
a
travel
guitar
and
that
guitar
is
really
cool
You
can
actually
fold
the
guitar
and
you
can
plug
headphones
into
it
but
it
s
acoustic
or
semi
acoustic
So
I
do
more
actually
than
I
did
last
year

Surprise
Surprise
Google
Plans
Wireless
Music
for
the
Home
Android
devices
such
as
these
can
stream
to
Apple
AirPlay
as
we
reported
yesterday
Today
Google
appears
to
have
fired
back
with
news
of
a
wireless
music
system
of
its
own
Just
yesterday
we
posted
a
widely
disseminated
guide
to
zapping
music
from
Android
smartphones
and
tablets
to
Apple
AirPlay
devices
Why
Because
Google
has
been
slacking
on
its
wireless
Fling
technology
leaving
Apple
to
eat
its
wireless
music
lunch
As
we
put
it
yesterday
Google
should
be
worried
This
is
how
people
develop
a
taste
for
Apple
We
didn
t
have
to
wait
long
for
Google
s
next
move
as
it
turned
out
Today
sources
connected
to
Google
told
the
Wall
Street
Journal
that
Google
is
planning
some
sort
of
amorphous
wireless
music
system
for
the
home
after
all
Talk
about
timing
Between
this
development
and
Obama
2012
s
Spotify
playlist
we
re
starting
to
feel
quite
influential
or
maybe
we
suffer
from
delusions
of
grandeur
Either
way
here
s
what
Google
appears
to
be
planning
in
terms
of
wireless
music
within
the
home
judging
the
shreds
of
information
reported
by
WSJ
Google
s
wireless
music
device
for
the
home
will
be
branded
either
Google
or
Android
It
will
be
available
later
this
year
It
will
be
sold
by
retailers
but
nobody
knows
which
ones
Like
Apple
AirPlay
does
for
iOS
it
would
stream
music
from
Android
devices
to
home
entertainment
systems
which
are
usually
the
nicest
speakers
in
the
house
That
s
why
we
think
the
television
is
such
a
killer
app
platform
Like
Apple
AirPlay
it
would
be
licensed
to
third
party
manufacturers
so
they
could
make
compatible
speaker
systems
Like
Apple
AirPlay
already
does
it
will
eventually
be
able
to
stream
video
too
Like
Apple
AirPlay
Apple
TV
and
Airport
Express
it
will
be
cheaper
than
Sonos
It
might
be
linked
to
Android
Home
something
a
Google
source
told
us
recently
as
well
so
you
d
be
able
to
control
your
air
conditioner
along
with
your
music
What
will
Google
do
next
Stay
tuned
to
find
out
apparently

Vote
on
the
Best
Fictional
Music
Apps
in
Untapped
Apps
Round
Three
We
ve
chased
down
reviewed
analyzed
and
cataloged
thousands
of
music
apps
at
Evolver
fm
in
the
past
year
but
countless
ideas
remain
for
developers
to
build
and
for
the
rest
of
us
armchair
inventors
to
conceive
Our
Untapped
Apps
surveys
consist
of
music
app
ideas
from
the
wacky
to
the
wonderful
for
your
reading
and
voting
pleasure
We
saw
some
great
results
from
round
one
and
round
two
now
we
re
on
to
the
third
round
of
Untapped
Apps
To
put
things
in
perspective
music
apps
with
certain
exceptions
don
t
save
lives
unlike
this
plan
for
mapping
defibrillators
with
apps
Still
powerful
well
thought
out
pleasant
to
use
music
technologies
undoubtedly
raise
the
quality
of
our
lives
In
that
spirit
Evolver
fm
s
Untapped
Apps
surveys
are
designed
to
tease
out
some
of
these
next
level
ideas
Anyone
can
submit
an
idea
for
the
next
round
and
when
we
re
satisfied
with
the
list
it
goes
up
for
voting
Without
further
ado
actually
with
a
little
more
ado
because
you
ll
have
to
click
through
another

iTunes
Genius
on

iPhone
Music
heads
have
a
new
way
to
connect
with
the
artists
they
love
on
iOS
devices
An
alternative
to
Apple
s
Genius
music
recommendation
software
Album
Scout
1
allows
users
to
discover
new
music
track
their
artists
and
share
what
they
find
with
their
friends
The
first
time
you
run
the
app
Album
Scout
automatically
grabs
information
from
your
iOS
device
s
library
and
instantly
provides
you
with
a
sleek
and
attractive
cover
flow
displaying
newly
released
albums
from
the
artists
in
your
collection
We
preferred
this
view
to
the
other
option
which
lets
you
slide
down
a
list
of
albums
Tap
any
album
to
listen
to
track
previews
and
see
how
popular
each
track
is
according
to
the
iTunes
store
If
you
like
what
you
hear
Album
Scout
can
connect
you
to
iTunes
so
your
shopping
spree
can
begin
Again
we
liked
the
cover
flow
version
best
but
one
advantage
exists
to
using
list
view
instead
a
Show
Greatest
Hits
filter
which
helps
deals
with
bands
like
Journey
that
tend
to
release
the
same
songs
in
multiple
collections
In
addition
to
the
new
releases
this
app
can
also
enhance
the
music
already
stored
on
your
iPhone
iPad
or
iPod
Touch
Tapping
Library
displays
your
iOS
device
s
music
collection
in
an
easy
to
navigate
format
including
biographies
a
list
of
similar
artists
and
the
artist
s
top
albums
all
from
Last
fm
Helpfully
you
can
choose
whether
or
not
to
scout
a
particular
artist
from
your
collection
or
scout
artists
you
like
even
if
their
music
isn
t
on
your
device
Whatever
you
find
you
can
share
with
friends
via
email
text
message
or
Twitter
from
within
the
app
The
functionality
of
Tunes
Genius
on
iOS
on
the
other
hand
is
limited
to
generating
playlists
from
music
stored
on
the
device
and
that
s
it
Album
Scout
developer
Matthew
Toohey
told
Evolver
fm
I
developed
Album
Scout
because
I
kept
realizing
good
albums
had
slipped
past
me
I
had
hoped
that
iTunes
Genius
would
be
good
for
this
purpose
but
I
found
it
was
very
hit
and
miss
It
kept
recommending
songs
from
the
past
that
I
had
already
decided
were
not
to
my
taste
good
apps
need
a
sharp
focus
and
so
I
chose
to
focus
only
on
the
discovery
of
new
music
That
way
you
can
stay
up
to
date
with
your
musical
tastes
with
Album
Scout
and
Genius
can
do
what
it
is
best
at
discovering
music
from
the
entire
catalog
We
had
fun
discovering
music
with
Album
Scout
a
great
app
for
fans
who
consistently
crave
for
new
music
For
1
you
can
start
scouting
too

Apple
s
AirPlay
gives
people
the
pleasure
of
watching
movies
looking
at
photos
and
of
course
listening
to
music
wirelessly
zapping
the

from
their

iPod
Touches
or
iPads
to
their
televisions
and
home
speaker
systems
with
a
variety
of
popular

What
about
Google
s
Android
devices
do
those
work
with
AirPlay
too
Last
year
Evolver
fm
reported
that
Apple
s
wireless
music
influence
was
in
fact
starting
to
be
felt
on
Android
Meanwhile
Google
s
competing
Fling
platform
has
effectively
been
a
non
starter
We
ve
since
seen
a
slow
but
steady
rise
in
Android
apps
that
stream
music
to
Apple
TV
Airport
Express
and
AirPlay
compatible
speakers
and
sound
systems
Google
should
be
worried
This
is
how
people
develop
a
taste
for
Apple
That
s
their
problem
To
help
Android
owners
who
want
in
on
wireless
home
music
without
waiting
for
Google
to
get
its
act
together
here
are
the
best
Android
apps
for
streaming
music
to
Apple
s
AirPlay
devices
Eye
C
Taglists
Taglists
by
Eye
C
The
first
Android
AirPlay
app
to
catch
our
attention
this
multi
platform
app
builds
on
Twitter
hash
tags
to
create
playlists
or
Taglists
out
of
music
on
YouTube
SoundCloud
and
elsewhere
and
share
them
on
your
social
networks
That
s
a
fairly
simple
and
ingenious
idea
but
we
mention
it
here
because
Eye
C
also
makes
it
easy
to
play
these
playlists
on
AirPlay
speakers
and
other
devices
Remote
For
iTunes
Apple
s
own
Remote
app
for
iPhone
and
iPad
is
popular
in
part
because
it
controls
music
on
computers
running
iTunes
and
can
extend
that
music
to
AirPlay
devices
too
all
without
music
fans
ever
touching
their
computers
Developer
Hyperfine
developed
an
Apple
Remote
counterpart
for
Android
and
Windows
Phone
that
does
pretty
much
the
same
thing
Using
its
sleek
black
layout
you
can
search
and
play
iTunes
music
on
a
computer
from
your
Android
Bonus
It
also
controls
volume
on
multiple
AirPlay
devices
individually
iMediaShare
iMediaShare
Lots
of
apps
can
stream
via
AirPlay
as
we
ve
seen
but
some
also
include
content
from
a
range
of
media
properties
built
right
in
Developer
Bianor
created
an
app
that
acts
sort
of
like
a
remote
control
that
s
also
the
cable
box
so
you
can
switch
between
between
online
channels
your
Android
s
music
library
and
other
media
services
and
stream
any
of
it
to
AirPlay
The
channel
surfing
interface
feels
like
the
iPhone
s
or
Android
s
graphical
list
of
app
icons
with
a
nice
selection
YouTube
The
Onion
CNN
Animal
Planet
etc
All
of
this
is
playable
on
a
long
list
of
hardware
thanks
to
DLNA
game
consoles
PlayStation3
XBox
360
televisions
Samsung
Sony
etc
audio
home
electronics
Sonos
Onkyo
etc
and
of
course
any
Airplay
enabled
device
It
s
a
monstrous
app
Twonky
PacketVideo
s
Twonky
comes
in
two
flavors
Twonky
Mobile
resembles
iMediaShare
in
that
it
s
an
all
inclusive
streaming
app
for
music
video
and
photos
to
lots
of
different
devices
but
with
a
different
look
and
feel
Then
there
s
Twonky
Music
which
works
as
a
conduit
for
your
Android
s
music
collection
or
your
favorite
web
radio
sources
to
any
AirPlay
or
DLNA
enabled
device
While
it
s
lighter
on
the
features
than
Twonky
Mobile
Twonky
Music
has
its
own
special
bonuses
the
Flipside
feature
is
one
of
the
tastiest
with
artist
information
biographies
lyrics
and
news
It
s
a
nice
feature
for
those
who
want
to
find
out
more
about
what
they
re
listening
to
without
switching
apps
AirBubble
Bubblesoft
s
offering
does
something
a
little
different
It
works
in
reverse
to
the
way
these
other
apps
work
Instead
of
sending
music
from
Android
to
AirPlay
devices
basically
acts
as
an
AirPlay
receiver
Connect
your
Android
to
some
speakers
fire
up
AirBubble
and
you
can
stream
from
iTunes
or
any
other
AirPlay
enabled
streamer
even
an
iPhone
to
your
sound
system
Honey
Player
As
its
developer
rich
high
puts
it
this
is
the
sweetest
player
for
Android
with
Airplay
It
s
exactly
that
nice
sweet
and
useful
This
simple
and
effective
music
player
streams
music
from
your
Android
s
music
library
to
any
AirPlay
device
without
a
lot
of
extra
bells
and
whistles
Its
classy
and
enjoyable
layout
lets
you
can
choose
some
music
pick
the
output
and
rate
your
music
with
ease
If
it
s
simple
you
re
after
you
just
found
it

Vincent
Morisset
bills
himself
as
a
web
friendly
director
which
is
a
fitting
distinction
Where
most
films
progress
in
a
linear
fashion
Morisset
takes
things
a
step
further
or
maybe
sideways
Through
simple
interactions
like
scrolling
a
mouse
across
a
computer
screen
or
complicated
ones
like
dancing
in
front
of
a
webcam
Morisset
s
films
ask
the
audience
to
participate
in
an
unfolding
narrative
His
approach
is
tailor
made
for
web
2
0
Just
as
Facebook
and
Twitter
are
only
worthwhile
when
users
get
involved
Morisset
s
work
truly
comes
alive
only
with
audience
input
Readers
may
know
Morisset
s
work
through
his
involvement
with
the
Grammy
winning
band
Arcade
Fire
with
whom
he
has
worked
since
their
2004
breakout
album
Funeral
Since
then
he
s
created
music
videos
interactive
web
content
and
the
2009
documentary
Mirroir
Noir
alongside
the
band
Most
recently
he
directed
the
beautifully
unsettling
video
for
The
Sprawl
II
Mountains
Beyond
Mountains
Arcade
Fire
s
latest
single
The
video
presents
characters
whose
behaviors
mimic
that
of
the
viewer
Dance
quickly
to
the
music
and
the
characters
will
do
the
same
slow
down
and
they
ll
follow
suit
If
you
stop
dancing
altogether
the
characters
stop
progressing
their
movements
stuck
in
an
endless
loop
Morisset
has
also
worked
with
Icelandic
post
rockers
Sigur
Ros
directing
that
band
s
concert
film
Inni
which
may
be
a
traditional
non
interactive
film
though
the
methods
of
its
creation
were
anything
but
He
shot
and
edited
the
movie
in
digital
HD
then
transferred
it
to
black
and
white
film
by
projecting
it
onto
a
screen
and
recording
that
projection
with
16mm
cameras
The
16mm
version
of
the
movie
was
then
itself
projected
as
Morisset
and
his
collaborators
improvised
manipulations
using
prisms
and
other
found
objects
Then
they
filmed
and
edited
that
version
using
digital
HD
equipment
The
result
was
uncanny
promotional
materials
accurately
describe
it
as
spare
and
near
monochromatic
in
its
tunnel
vision
inviting
both
intimacy
and
claustrophobia
We
recently
spoke
with
Morisset
about
the
ideas
behind
his
work
collaborating
with
musicians
and
his
complicated
relationship
with
technology
This
interview
has
been
edited
for
length
and
clarity
Andy
Cush
Evolver

I
wanted
to
start
by
asking
you
about
your
background
especially
the
interactive
side
of
your
art
How
did
you
come
to
work
in
this
particular
format
Vincent
Morisset
Director
When
I
was
younger
I
wanted
to
go
into
cinema
so
I
went
to
school
in
that
direction
When
I
was
in
university
I
was
in
this
communication
program
You
had
to
decide
whether
to
go
into
TV
cinema
or
radio
The
year
I
had
to
choose
my
profile
they
opened
up
this
new
program
called
multimedia
and
it
just
fit
with
my
personality
I
m
a
guy
who
can
touch
every
aspect
of
it
and
so
I
jumped
in
that
program
This
was
in
the
late
90s
so
my
path
kind
of
changed
at
that
point
For
a
couple
of
years
I
d
been
mainly
developing
graphic
based
websites
because
at
that
time
that
was
the
limitation
of
the
medium
In
the
beginning
of
the
00s
the
bandwidth
allowed
us
to
play
more
and
more
with
video
so
at
that
point
my
two
loves
if
I
may
say
joined
back
together
I
started
to
do
more
and
more
video
based
projects
I
was
part
of
a
team
with
other
people
and
I
was
the
guy
that
was
more
comfortable
with
technology
I
don
t
consider
myself
a
geek
I
don
t
love
programming
but
I
learned
how
to
code
in
Lingo
and
in
ActionScript
to
make
projects
happen
So
I
have
this
kind
of
self
taught
programming
background
but
at
the
same
time
I
studied
cinema
At
some
point
those
two
backgrounds
collided
and
I
started
doing
what
we
now
call
interactive
video
Evolver
fm
Do
you
see
the
technology
as
worth
pursuing
on
it
s
own
making
something
with
the
most
high
tech
tools
available
Or
is
it
more
of
a
means
to
achieve
an
artistic
vision
Morisset
I
m
not
a
geek
I
m
not
really
excited
about
the
technology
for
its
own
sake
I
think
it
offers
amazing
possibilities
but
I
m
not
one
of
those
guys
who
get
excited
just
because
of
it
Ideas
always
drive
my
projects
and
I
use
the
tools
that
are
around
me
to
achieve
them
I
think
it
s
important
that
we
understand
the
possibilities
and
the
limitations
of
those
tools
but
for
me
it
s
important
that
the
projects
are
driven
by
ideas
so
that
they
don
t
become
technology
demos
or
whatever
Evolver
fm
A
lot
of
your
work
though
technologically
impressive
manages
to
feel
very
handmade
and
human
the
animations
in
the
interactive
film
Bla
Bla
for
instance
or
the
homespun
quality
of
this
newest
Arcade
Fire
video
Sprawl
II
Morisset
Thanks
I
think
there
s
a
paradox
about
my
relationship
with
technology
In
a
way
I
love
it
One
of
my
mottos
is
The
web
is
fun
I
love
this
platform
I
love
this
medium
but
the
way
we
connect
with
images
on
our
laptop
is
really
different
from
the
way
we
relate
to
images
on
a
TV
screen
Since
I
want
to
trigger
emotions
through
my
projects
I
work
hard
so
that
we
kind
of
forget
that
we
re
in
front
of
a
computer
We
forget
about
the
technology
and
it
just
feels
like
a
kind
of
weird
magical
thing
reacting
to
what
you
do
Evolver
fm
Would
you
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
Sprawl
II
video
your
processes
behind
it
and
how
it
came
to
be
Morisset
I
ve
been
working
with
the
band
forever
back
since
Funeral
so
we
have
this
ongoing
creative
collaboration
going
on
When
they
were
recording
The
Suburbs
I
was
working
as
artistic
director
on
the
whole
visual
aspect
of
the
artwork
juggling
different
ideas
for
various
projects
For
a
while
I
wanted
to
develop
an
interactive
video
project
that
would
be
free
of
any
interface
just
this
thing
that
s
really
spontaneous
and
primitive
I
showed
this
really
basic
little
demo
to
Regine
Chassagne
Arcade
Fire
s
singer
multi
instrumentalist
where
you
just
waved
your
hand
at
the
webcam
and
it
triggered
sounds
and
flickered
the
screen
She
said
she
thought
they
d
have
a
song
that
was
a
little
more
pop
the
kind
of
song
you
could
dance
to
and
that
she
d
play
it
for
me
when
it
was
done
At
the
end
it
ended
up
being
The
Sprawl
II
It
was
kind
of
disco
ish
and
for
me
it
fit
perfectly
with
the
concept
So
time
passed
I
worked
on
other
projects
and
at
the
end
of
the
album
cycle
I
was
like
Hey
we
should
really
do
this
The
band
was
totally
into
doing
a
dance
activated
video
but
they
wanted
to
make
sure
people
without
a
webcam
or
a
good
computer
would
still
be
able
to
have
a
sense
of
the
world
we
were
creating
so
we
decided
to
do
a
kind
of
hybrid
project
We
would
have
a
traditional
film
that
could
be
seen
on
YouTube
or
on
TV
and
parallel
to
that
would
be
this
interactive
video
That
was
kind
of
a
challenge
because
out
of
the
same
shoot
I
had
to
do
two
parallel
projects
for
two
totally
different
mediums
Evolver
fm
Thematically
the
album
seems
conflicted
about
the
state
of
modern
life
as
we
know
it
and
your
video
dovetails
nicely
with
that
You
created
these
images
that
at
times
almost
feel
like
home
video
and
presented
them
in
a
new
confusing
context
A
still
from
Morisset
s
interactive
video
for
The
Sprawl
II
Morisset
We
wanted
to
have
something
that
would
be
really
simple
and
straightforward
but
not
boring
So
we
asked
ourselves
what
we
like
about
music
videos
and
decided
to
make
something
that
felt
spontaneous
and
fun
with
a
bit
of
strangeness
added
It
s
always
funny
when
I
first
show
the
project
to
different
kinds
of
people
When
they
start
to
understand
the
cause
and
effect
of
their
gestures
and
the
echo
in
the
choreography
there
s
this
moment
when
they
re
like
Whoa
They
get
a
bit
freaked
out
And
then
when
you
pass
this
moment
you
kind
of
assimilate
it
and
make
the
video
your
own
It
s
funny
how
different
people
interact
with
it
depending
on
their
personality
or
their
cultural
background
Some
people
are
more
analytical
about
it
some
people
just
let
loose
It
s
funny
to
see
how
people
connect
with
a
piece
like
that
Evolver
fm
The
interactivity
makes
it
just
as
much
about
whatever
baggage
you
re
bringing
to
the
table
as
a
spectator
as
it
is
about
what
the
artist
put
into
it
Morisset
It
also
connects
to
what
the
song
is
about
There
s
this
character
alienated
by
her
environment
who
wants
to
get
loose
and
escape
from
that
alienating
environment
The
fact
that
you
dance
in
front
of
your
computer
is
also
a
bit
liberating
and
kind
of
weird
because
you
re
not
in
a
context
where
you
normally
dance
You
re
at
your
work
computer
or
in
your
living
room
and
there
s
this
moment
where
you
cross
a
tiny
boundary
Evolver
fm
One
of
the
criticisms
you
often
hear
about
internet
culture
is
that
it
causes
people
to
have
short
attention
spans
about
the
media
they
consume
Because
your
interactive
work
is
mostly
experienced
online
by
its
nature
there
s
a
good
chance
some
people
won
t
give
it
their
full
attention
and
others
will
perceive
it
as
frivolous
Does
that
bother
you
at
all
Morisset
No
not
at
all
I
like
this
gray
area
about
music
video
culture
There
s
something
really
exciting
about
that
niche
because
you
re
juggling
between
two
worlds
You
connect
to
a
broad
audience
but
you
re
able
to
propose
things
that
are
unusual
and
sometimes
a
bit
challenging
It
s
okay
if
people
see
it
one
way
or
another
It
s
part
of
the
process
part
of
the
game
I
quite
like
the
fact
that
we
are
able
to
reach
all
kinds
of
people
and
present
it
in
different
contexts
At
some
point
you
don
t
have
control
over
what
contexts
the
piece
will
be
re
presented
in
so
you
don
t
know
how
people
will
look
at
it
And
I
think
that
s
kind
of
cool
Evolver
fm
Yeah
that
must
be
pretty
exciting
Just
releasing
it
into
the
wild
Morisset
You
need
to
embrace
that
It
s
part
of
what
the
web
is
Evolver
fm
There
seems
to
be
a
connection
with
music
in
a
lot
of
your
work
even
the
stuff
that
isn
t
commissioned
by
a
band
When
you
began
your
career
as
an
artist
did
you
know
that
you
d
have
this
close
relationship
with
music
Or
is
that
something
that
evolved
on
its
own
Morisset
Your
life
is
about
accidents
happy
accidents
The
fact
that
I
started
to
work
with
Arcade
Fire
something
like
eight
years
ago
it
led
me
to
doing
projects
that
bounced
into
other
projects
and
other
projects
and
other
people
asking
me
to
work
with
them
In
the
last
years
I
ve
just
been
lucky
enough
to
work
with
amazing
artists
I
would
say
it
s
been
this
kind
of
theory
of
encounters
I
didn
t
look
to
do
just
music
related
projects
it
just
kind
of
happened
like
that
And
I
must
say
I
decided
that
in
the
next
year
I
d
like
to
explore
other
things
But
I
love
music
and
I
think
there
s
a
strong
connection
between
music
and
image
especially
for
interactive
stuff
When
you
re
playing
with
non
linear
editing
the
music
gives
the
thing
a
kind
of
emotional
spine
It
gives
it
a
structure
Even
if
you
re
playing
with
something
that
s
really
reactive
at
least
you
have
this
backbone
to
keep
the
tension
and
dramatic
crescendos
of
a
piece
So
it
s
something
really
useful
for
me
as
an
artist
working
with
interactive
material
but
I
don
t
way
to
be
pigeonholed
to
do
music
stuff
Like
I
said
before
I
like
to
touch
all
kinds
of
things
Evolver
fm
Something
that
attracted
me
to
Inni
was
the
hands
on
analog
manipulation
of
the
film
that
you
guys
were
doing
You
re
taking
something
that
was
originally
filmed
digitally
in
HD
and
working
with
it
like
you
would
with
clay
or
paint
as
a
physical
artistic
object
Could
you
explain
that
process
Morisset
I
see
that
as
a
traditional
film
It
s
linear
and
about
an
hour
long
but
I
took
a
lot
of
the
expertise
that
I
developed
with
web
projects
into
that
process
I
m
always
trying
to
destroy
the
slick
perfect
a
bit
soulless
look
of
computer
ish
imagery
In
Bla
Bla
it
was
the
same
I
did
some
old
school
stop
motion
with
a
puppet
then
rotoscoped
the
face
in
3D
so
that
I
could
map
the
mouth
and
the
eyes
in
real
time
So
again
I
was
working
with
something
that
was
really
fragile
and
imperfect
but
using
sophisticated
technology
along
with
it
With
Inni
it
s
kind
of
the
other
way
around
We
took
advantage
of
these
really
light
sensitive
cameras
and
were
able
to
edit
the
film
in
a
straightforward
efficient
way
But
there
was
this
too
crisp
feel
to
it
it
was
almost
like
watching
the
news
on
TV
It
kind
of
killed
all
the
magic
and
the
aura
of
what
Sigur
Ros
is
So
I
thought
we
d
try
a
more
spontaneous
approach
with
the
post
production
When
I
pitched
the
idea
to
Sigur
Ros
I
was
comparing
it
to
when
Neil
Young
did
the
Dead
Man
soundtrack
He
sat
in
front
of
the
Jim
Jarmusch
film
with
his
guitar
looking
at
it
for
the
first
time
and
just
jammed
over
it
There
s
this
really
volatile
imperfect
thing
about
it
that
makes
it
so
alive
and
beautiful
Again
computers
can
do
amazing
things
but
there
s
something
about
organic
handmade
stuff
You
can
t
fake
it
You
just
need
to
put
your
hands
in
the
dirt
and
do
it
Evolver
fm
Tell
me
about
your
synchronized
artwork
for
The
Suburbs
Morisset
Well
I
think
there
s
a
lot
of
potential
in
this
really
straightforward
way
of
presenting
digital
content
synchronized
with
the
song
It
struck
me
that
more
people
haven
t
embraced
this
path
I
was
like
damn
I
thought
it
was
such
a
cool
idea
Why
aren
t
other
people
doing
it
It
s
kind
of
a
no
brainer
It
makes
no
sense
that
in
2012
we
re
still
stuck
with
a
JPEG
for
the
whole
album
It
s
bizarre
It
s
been
blocked
by
Apple
in
a
way
It
couldn
t
be
sold
in
their
store
because
it
s
not
standard
MP3s
but
it
s
not
exactly
an
app
either
Evolver
fm
It
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
Bj
rk
s
Biophilia
suite
of
apps
Obviously
they
re
very
different
but
they
seem
of
a
piece
in
a
way
because
both
are
looking
at
the
album
format
and
asking
what
could
we
be
doing
differently
in
2012
Morisset
With
the
Bj
rk
thing
you
need
to
get
into
the
app
to
listen
to
the
song
You
re
kind
of
forced
to
be
involved
in
it
For
me
listening
to
music
is
something
that
can
go
both
ways
I
can
remember
sitting
on
the
couch
when
I
was
younger
and
opening
the
vinyl
sleeve
and
reading
the
lyrics
But
when
I
m
on
the
bus
I
don
t
want
to
have
to
hold
the
record
sleeve
I
want
to
put
it
on
sleep
put
it
in
my
pocket
and
still
be
able
to
listen
to
it
I
still
want
to
put
it
on
random
with
other
songs
I
still
want
to
be
able
to
put
those
tracks
in
a
playlist
The
Bj
rk
thing
is
cool
in
itself
but
I
would
love
it
if
it
could
be
embedded
in
your
listening
environment
If
you
re
in
that
you
can
t
do
anything
else
If
you
listen
to
the
app
album
you
re
in
that
so
you
have
your
virtual
booklet
open
at
all
times
Evolver
fm
Have
you
seen
any
interactive
work
for
bands
that
other
people
are
doing
that
inspires
you
Morisset
It
s
not
interactive
but
I
do
like
Radio
Soulwax
It
s
a
set
of
mixtapes
with
evolving
artwork
Evolver
fm
Is
there
anything
happening
in
the
world
of
more
mainstream
narrative
film
that
s
got
you
excited
Is
that
a
world
that
you
would
ever
consider
trying
to
work
in
Morisset
I
m
embracing
traditional
linear
films
I
ve
done
two
films
so
it
s
not
a
world
I
m
totally
unfamiliar
with
One
thing
I
think
is
exciting
is
how
those
films
get
around
now
I
think
we
re
on
the
verge
of
changing
distribution
and
how
we
consume
films
so
films
that
are
a
bit
more
niche
are
able
to
reach
an
audience
more
easily
I
think
Mirroir
Noir
the
Arcade
Fire
documentary
was
one
of
the
first
feature
films
to
be
originally
distributed
online
When
it
first
came
out
the
only
way
you
could
see
it
was
to
buy
it
online
and
download
the
HD
video
It
was
a
bit
peculiar
no
film
festivals
no
theater
screenings
At
the
end
I
think
it
was
successful
because
we
were
able
to
reach
in
a
single
day
the
whole
fan
community
And
people
just
wanted
to
see
that
film
I
think
if
we
had
gone
down
the
traditional
path
people
would
have
found
a
torrent
of
it
not
because
they
wanted
to
pirate
they
just
wanted
to
see
it
so
badly
So
in
a
way
we
short
circuited
the
threat
and
in
a
way
that
was
good
After
that
the
film
got
screened
at
some
theaters
and
some
film
events
So
the
film
s
life
was
inverted
but
in
a
good
way

Surprise
Surprise
Google
Plans
Wireless
Music
for
the
Home
Android
devices
such
as
these
can
stream
to
Apple
AirPlay
as
we
reported
yesterday
Today
Google
appears
to
have
fired
back
with
news
of
a
wireless
music
system
of
its
own
Just
yesterday
we
posted
a
widely
disseminated
guide
to
zapping
music
from
Android
smartphones
and
tablets
to
Apple
AirPlay
devices
Why
Because
Google
has
been
slacking
on
its
wireless
Fling
technology
leaving
Apple
to
eat
its
wireless
music
lunch
As
we
put
it
yesterday
Google
should
be
worried
This
is
how
people
develop
a
taste
for
Apple
We
didn
t
have
to
wait
long
for
Google
s
next
move
as
it
turned
out
Today
sources
connected
to
Google
told
the
Wall
Street
Journal
that
Google
is
planning
some
sort
of
amorphous
wireless
music
system
for
the
home
after
all
Talk
about
timing
Between
this
development
and
Obama
2012
s
Spotify
playlist
we
re
starting
to
feel
quite
influential
or
maybe
we
suffer
from
delusions
of
grandeur
Either
way
here
s
what
Google
appears
to
be
planning
in
terms
of
wireless
music
within
the
home
judging
the
shreds
of
information
reported
by
WSJ
Google
s
wireless
music
device
for
the
home
will
be
branded
either
Google
or
Android
It
will
be
available
later
this
year
It
will
be
sold
by
retailers
but
nobody
knows
which
ones
Like
Apple
AirPlay
does
for
iOS
it
would
stream
music
from
Android
devices
to
home
entertainment
systems
which
are
usually
the
nicest
speakers
in
the
house
That
s
why
we
think
the
television
is
such
a
killer
app
platform
Like
Apple
AirPlay
it
would
be
licensed
to
third
party
manufacturers
so
they
could
make
compatible
speaker
systems
Like
Apple
AirPlay
already
does
it
will
eventually
be
able
to
stream
video
too
Like
Apple
AirPlay
Apple
TV
and
Airport
Express
it
will
be
cheaper
than
Sonos
It
might
be
linked
to
Android
Home
something
a
Google
source
told
us
recently
as
well
so
you
d
be
able
to
control
your
air
conditioner
along
with
your
music
What
will
Google
do
next
Stay
tuned
to
find
out
apparently

It
s
been
about
a
year
since
we
last
met
How
are
things
going
with
you
lately
Daniel
Ek
CEO
Spotify
I
ve
got
a
bit
of
a
sore
throat
right
now
if
you
re
asking
about
me
personally
but
Spotify
is
doing
fantastic
That
s
always
great
Evolver
fm
Can
you
give
us
a
preview
of
what
you
intend
to
discuss
at
the
GRAMMY
Foundation
s
Entertainment
Law
Initiative
Luncheon
Ek
There
s
a
lot
of
interesting
debate
going
on
now
about
streaming
and
I
like
that
it
s
become
more
about
streaming
and
not
what
s
free
or
not
But
what
I
really
want
to
talk
about
is
the
future
We
have
this
debate
about
where
it
is
right
now
but
I
still
think
streaming
is
really
in
its
infancy
and
I
want
to
outline
the
future
of
what
that
looks
like
what
it
will
actually
mean
for
the
music
industry
What
would
it
mean
for
how
to
promote
an
act
Or
for
revenues
We
re
at
a
time
now
when
more
and
more
people
are
saying
Hey
actually
this
is
working
and
we
ve
got
two
and
a
half
million
paying
customers
and
that
number
is
growing
very
very
quickly
and
it
keeps
accelerating
Personally
speaking
I
am
more
bullish
on
the
future
of
the
music
industry
than
ever
before
and
I
think
we
re
kind
of
entering
a
golden
age
in
music
Evolver
fm
What
will
that
golden
age
look
like
Spotify
gets
political
as
Barack
Obama
s
reelection
campaigners
posted
a
Spotify
playlist
featuring
their
favorite
songs
including
some
of
the
president
s
Ek
First
I
think
we
re
talking
about
a
world
where
I
believe
most
of
it
will
be
access
There
will
be
ownership
as
well
I
think
the
total
amount
of
revenues
back
to
the
industry
is
going
to
grow
We
ve
paid
over
200
million
to
rightsholders
already
and
it
s
still
in
the
early
days
So
for
me
part
of
it
is
talking
about
the
growth
story
of
how
we
get
the
music
industry
back
to
where
it
used
to
be
and
probably
even
past
that
The
second
part
is
in
a
world
where
music
is
really
about
you
listening
to
music
and
your
friends
discovering
it
from
you
what
does
that
mean
about
how
we
break
acts
and
promote
acts
Spotify
up
until
now
hasn
t
really
done
a
great
job
of
helping
that
but
you
re
going
to
see
us
doing
more
and
more
to
break
acts
and
try
to
really
promote
them
as
well
Looking
at
Spotify
today
and
fast
forwarding
three
years
to
2015
Where
s
the
music
industry
Where
s
Spotify
and
what
does
this
mean
to
a
band
manager
or
label
I
think
it
s
exciting
times
Creating
a
record
is
really
about
three
core
components
The
first
thing
is
creating
the
actual
record
It
used
to
be
really
expensive
to
do
that
and
now
really
anyone
can
record
a
record
even
in
their
own
homes
The
second
piece
is
that
it
used
to
be
really
expensive
distributing
the
record
and
now
with
iTunes
Spotify
and
other
services
distributing
another
digital
copy
basically
doesn
t
cost
anything
But
the
funny
thing
is
marketing
used
to
be
kind
of
simple
in
the
old
days
You
used
to
be
able
to
just
put
it
on
the
radio
or
MTV
and
it
just
worked
If
it
was
a
good
song
the
record
started
selling
based
on
that
Today
the
media
landscape
is
much
more
fragmented
MTV
s
not
about
music
anymore
and
radio
is
even
hard
er
to
break
through
There
are
tons
of
radio
channels
and
most
of
them
play
stuff
people
already
know
So
marketing
an
act
today
is
really
really
really
expensive
If
it
went
from
being
a
broadcast
medium
of
just
getting
it
out
there
to
everyone
to
a
social
medium
where
music
is
discovered
through
friends
what
does
that
mean
for
the
marketing
of
music
I
think
that
s
another
core
component
of
getting
this
to
work
Evolver
fm
That
s
a
really
good
point
I
guess
we
re
also
seeing
that
with
some
of
the
audio
ads
within
Spotify
which
are
clips
of
songs
Ek
Hopefully
I
ll
also
be
able
to
go
into
some
interesting
things
we
ve
seen
during
my
address
especially
with
Facebook
where
there
are
acts
like
Foster
The
People
who
kind
of
blew
up
on
the
service
really
because
friends
started
discovering
them
from
other
people
That
s
a
great
story
for
us
to
show
Look
this
works
People
discovered
it
not
just
through
radio
where
they
didn
t
have
much
promotion
but
because
friends
kept
recommending
and
listening
to
it
so
their
friends
in
turn
discovered
it
Evolver
fm
Is
that
part
of
the
decision
to
require
a
Facebook
login
on
Spotify
because
you
see
the
social
sharing
as
so
important
Ek
We
look
at
the
sharing
of
music
as
really
really
important
for
our
business
We
ve
found
that
the
more
social
our
users
are
i
e
they
re
sharing
music
the
faster
they
grow
their
own
music
library
And
the
faster
they
grow
their
music
library
the
faster
they
become
paying
customers
That
s
really
the
rationale
for
us
not
really
the
marketing
side
but
we
feel
that
the
combination
of
Facebook
and
Spotify
is
a
positive
thing
Evolver
fm
I
remember
when
we
first
met
in
New
York
years
ago
and
you
said
that
you
wanted
to
create
a
legal
version
of
the
sort
of
experience
that
people
have
in
the
P2P
version
My
favorite
thing
about
Napster
was
searching
for
one
rare
band
that
I
loved
If
someone
had
that
then
I
trusted
them
and
knew
that
I
was
going
to
like
anything
else
they
had
Ek
Yep
Evolver
fm
It
seems
like
you
have
succeeded
in
translating
that
to
a
legal
music
service
so
congratulations
on
that
Ek
Yes
we
ve
done
that
Right
now
it
s
skewed
more
toward
your
friends
What
we
want
to
make
it
skew
toward
is
you
discovering
other
people
with
great
music
taste
as
well
Evolver
fm
Are
there
any
misunderstandings
about
Spotify
that
you
d
like
to
clear
up
Ek
I
feel
to
an
extent
that
we
re
a
victim
of
our
own
success
What
I
mean
by
that
is
especially
if
you
look
at
the
media
Spotify
is
seen
as
this
gigantic
company
the
size
of
Apple
s
iTunes
which
is
not
really
true
We
re
really
starting
up
here
and
that
s
how
we
feel
about
it
If
you
look
at
a
country
like
the
U
S
there
s
sub
1
percent
of
the
population
that
s
even
using
any
legal
streaming
service
I
think
that
sometimes
people
perceive
us
as
being
a
lot
larger
than
we
are
and
that
s
an
important
point
to
make
Spotify

Another
point
I
want
to
make
is
that
this
is
a
very
very
different
model
than
just
selling
a
record
Everyone
talks
about
volume
and
what
this
means
in
terms
of
numbers
and
I
don
t
think
it
s
comparable
In
the
world
today
there
are
500
million
people
listening
to
music
online
Out
of
them
there
s
only
a
very
small
portion
who
are
avid
iTunes
customers
which
we
look
at
today
as
being
the
majority
of
the
digital
music
ecosystem
So
the
way
we
re
approaching
this
is
we
want
to
reach
the
500
million
people
of
whom
the
vast
majority
aren
t
really
using
iTunes
I
d
also
like
to
address
people
who
think
they
ll
gain
sales
by
not
being
on
Spotify
There
s
not
a
shred
of
data
to
suggest
that
In
fact
all
the
information
available
points
to
streaming
services
helping
to
drive
sales
Album

were
up
in
the

S

launched
for
the
first

than

Spotify
users
are
the
exact
same
people
who
used
to
listen
to
music
every
day
on
YouTube
whose
entire
music
collection
was
pulled
off
BitTorrent
sites
By
offering
them
a
compelling
music
service
that
allows
them
to
discover
hundreds
of
new
artists
not
just
their
favorites
pulled
from
YouTube
or
pirated
we
re
seeing
millions
move
back
to
listening
to
music
legally
after
years
of
being
left
out
in
the
cold
They
re
helping
pay
a
ton
of
money
back
to
the
industry
You
re
talking
10
million
active
users
2
5
million
subscribers
most
of
them
paying
120
a
year
which
is
double
the
amount
of
your
average
iTunes
user
Do
you
really
want
to
hold
back
your
album
from
people
who
are
finally
paying
for
music
again
If
you
think
that
by
doing
so
you
re
getting
them
to
buy
your
album
on
a
CD
or
as
an
album
download
again
there
s
absolutely
no
evidence
to
back
that
theory
up
Your
album
s
getting
shared
en
masse
over
BitTorrent
over
YouTube
It
s
there
right
now
but
you
decide
that
it
s
the
paying
loyal
music
fans
that
should
lose
out
It
makes
no
sense
Another
thing
I
want
to
mention
When
someone
creates
a
Spotify
playlist
and
they
put
an
album
or
songs
in
there
they
don
t
just
play
them
once
What
actually
happens
is
they
keep
repeatedly
playing
them
What
I
think
is
interesting
and
what
we
do
here
is
that
the
sales
cycle
of
that
record
is
anywhere
from
four
to
12
weeks
in
most
typical
cases
With
Spotify
we
keep
seeing
the
effect
up
to
25
35
weeks
or
even
a
year
So
when
looking
at
the
effect
a
certain
record
release
has
one
in
the
world
of
Spotify
has
to
look
not
just
at
the
first
12
weeks
but
actually
look
at
six
months
and
probably
even
a
year
after
because
it
keeps
playing
And
every
time
someone
plays
a
song
we
pay
the
music
industry
I
think
that
is
probably
the
biggest
misunderstanding
everyone
keeps
comparing
an
apple
to
what
s
actually
not
an
apple
but
hopefully
a
tastier
fruit
Evolver
fm
It
seems
like
that
would
give
musicians
an
incentive
to
make
music
that
people
want
to
listen
to
over
and
over
again
which
could
be
good
culturally
It
s
not
just
about
making
a
splash
Ek
Yeah
At
Spotify
we
really
want
you
to
democratically
win
as
a
musician
We
want
you
to
win
because
your
music
is
the
best
music
And
the
only
way
you
can
win
in
the
Spotify
ecosystem
unless
you
buy
advertising
is
by
friends
recommending
you
to
other
friends
And
they
do
so
by
listening
to
your
music
They
vote
with
their
hands
and
feet
I
think
that
s
a
pretty
great
thing
for
an
artist
that
s
creating
great
music
What
s
interesting
to
me
looking
at
the
greatest
acts
of
last
year
is
that
many
of
those
acts
are
acts
that
five
or
10
years
ago
may
not
have
even
had
a
record
deal
but
they
ve
grown
like
one
of
my
favorite
bands
Mumford
Sons
I
don
t
know
how
much
they
ve
been
growing
on
social
networks
but
I
can
tell
you
the
reason
why
I
discovered
them
was
someone
actually
sent
me
a
YouTube
clip
and
then
I
started
searching
for
them
on
Spotify
and
I
discovered
this
fantastic
band
I
guess
the
point
is
that
in
the
future
we
re
getting
more
and
more
connected
all
over
the
world
and
hopefully
that
will
mean
that
great
music
will
prevail
because
your
friends
will
listen
to
it
and
share
it
with
other
friends
Spotify
can
send
music
via
Apple
AirPlay
to
home
stereos
and
other
devices
Evolver
fm
The
two
big
areas
for
growth
in
digital
music
seem
to
be
the
car
and
the
television
What
can
you
tell
us
about
Spotify
s
strategy
there
Ek
Much
like
we
believe
a
strength
of
the
CD
was
being
ubiquitous
that
you
can
take
a
CD
and
put
it
in
any
player
and
just
press
play
that
s
how
easy
we
want
it
to
be
to
play
music
with
Spotify
As
more
and
more
devices
are
getting
connected
the
base
of
people
who
will
want
to
listen
to
music
with
those
devices
will
increase
and
that
s
something
we
re
hugely
excited
about
Evolver
fm
To
switch
gears
for
a
second
I
was
very
interested
to
cover
what
Spotify
is
doing
with
apps
You
can
build
desktop
apps
on
Spotify
s
catalog
iOS
apps
and
now
you
can
build
apps
within
the
Spotify
desktop
client
How
significant
do
you
see
that
ecosystem
Is
it
going
to
be
a
major
part
of
Spotify
s
growth
in
the
future
Ek
Yeah
we
definitely
do
believe
that
There
are
multiple
ways
one
can
look
at
this
but
what
we
re
trying
to
primarily
address
is
that
when
it
comes
to
music
we
ve
got
15
or
16
million
tracks
I
don
t
even
know
what
the
exact
number
is
but
there
s
an
endless
amount
of
music
You
could
listen
your
whole
life
to
the
Spotify
catalog
and
you
probably
wouldn
t
get
through
a
third
of
it
What
s
needed
on
top
of
that
is
curated
experiences
Part
of
that
curated
experience
is
people
building
playlists
and
sharing
those
playlists
with
their
friends
But
another
part
is
trusted
sources
people
who
tend
to
be
really
really
good
at
music
There
are
things
you
can
offer
with
music
that
aren
t
Spotify
s
core
competencies
like
lyrics
ticketing
and
other
things
We
felt
that
the
Internet
really
was
silent
and
that
music
was
missing
We
wanted
to
create
a
platform
to
allow
people
to
interact
with
music
whether
that
s
providing
curation
or
providing
more
interesting
experiences
or
even
using
that
to
give
you
other
venues
such
as
ticketing
and
merchandising
We
think
all
of
those
things
are
super
exciting
but
they
re
not
our
core
competency
We
might
have
100
or
150
engineers
and
that
s
great
but
already
now
with
the
Spotify
platform
we
ve
got
thousands
of
engineers
working
on
creating
more
interesting
music
experiences
And
that
s
ultimately
really
good
for
the
music
industry
because
there
are
more
avenues
now
to
listen
to
music
and
interact
with
music
Ultimately
that
s
going
to
make
more
people
care
about
music
and
pay
for
it
again

We
ve
talked
a
little
bit
about
the
royalty
payouts
Some
people
have
said
from
time
to
time
that
the
payouts
are
too
low
and
others
point
out
that
with
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
changing
hands
how
can
that
be
low
A
few
artists
are
deciding
not
to
have
releases
on
Spotify
so
I
guess
one
conclusion
to
draw
would
be
that
it
s
too
difficult
to
do
freemium
streaming
to
pay
what
seem
like
very
high
royalties
in
one
sense
but
on
a
per
artist
level
some
people
say
it
s
not
very
much
How
do
you
see
this
playing
out
Ek
As
I
said
a
lot
of
people
try
to
compare
an
apple
to
another
fruit
and
as
I
started
out
saying
we
look
at
it
as
us
being
in
our
infancy
We
haven
t
even
started
really
We
re
still
a
really
young
company
So
ultimately
our
view
is
that
the
royalty
checks
we
re
paying
out
now
of
course
we
re
happy
that
there
s
progress
being
made
but
it
s
still
only
in
its
early
days
and
it
will
keep
growing
Last
year
was
a
great
testament
to
that
when
in
May
we
hit
a
million
paying
customers
and
at
the
end
of
that
year
we
were
at
two
and
a
half
million
That
s
a
significant
increase
in
customers
who
are
paying
100
bucks
a
year
And
Spotify
keeps
growing
at
that
pace
if
not
faster
So
I
think
the
royalty
checks
as
they
re
combined
will
definitely
grow
But
I
also
want
to
kind
of
caution
people
We
get
a
lot
of
media
attention
People
think
we
re
actively
seeking
that
media
attention
and
in
most
instances
we
re
not
People
just
like
the
product
so
much
that
they
like
to
write
about
it
I
find
this
when
I
meet
artists
They
actually
think
we
re
a
lot
larger
than
we
are
I
say
Look
we
re
not
really
We
re
roughly
10
million
users
in
countries
where
in
total
there
are
600
million
people
And
out
of
them
at
least
250
million
are
listening
to
music
online
so
we
re
actually
a
very
small
part
of
this
right
now
I
want
to
add
that
my
home
country
Sweden
where
Spotify
has
grown
to
scale
if
you
look
at
the
artists
now
the
vast
majority
of
the
artists
are
getting
between
50
and
60
percent
of
all
their
income
from
Spotify
And
I
think
that
s
what
s
going
to
happen
when
this
model
gets
to
scale
And
the
music
industry
in
Sweden
is
growing
Evolver
fm
The
latest
thing
with
Spotify
and
Facebook
is
this
ability
to
listen
to
the
same
thing
at
the
same
time
which
I
think
is
a
fantastic
feature
It
makes
music
not
only
something
between
a
person
an
MP3
player
and
a
pair
of
headphones
Over
the
long
term
is
this
going
to
become
a
mainstream
activity
or
is
it
just
for
people
like
me
who
use
the
latest
stuff
and
get
a
kick
out
of
it
Ek
Our
approach
is
that
we
don
t
know
With
that
said
we
think
music
is
the
most
social
thing
there
is
and
we
think
people
want
to
interact
with
music
The
background
on
that
feature
is
that
it
was
actually
built
by
Facebook
which
we
think
is
cool
One
of
the
engineers
there
showed
it
to
me
one
time
when
I
came
to
visit
and
he
was
like
What
do
you
think
about
this
I
said
This
is
awesome
you
should
just
release
it
The
coolest
thing
is
that
he
could
build
that
feature
because
Spotify
is
a
platform
so
he
could
interact
with
our
APIs
create
it
and
put
it
on
the
Facebook
service
We
didn
t
actually
interact
that
much
to
get
this
done
but
it
was
one
of
the
things
that
the
Facebook
folks
were
really
passionate
about
and
I
think
I
hope
and
I
believe
that
there
will
be
10
other
projects
similar
to
this
around
the
Web
right
now
where
people
build
cool
interesting
experiences
Two
weeks
ago
someone
who
created
the
Spotify
app
Soundrop
released
their
own
iOS
app
So
now
all
of
a
sudden
I
have
a
room
where
I
m
walking
around
and
people
talk
about
music
where
they
vote
for
which
track
will
come
next
It
s
kind
of
a
social
radio
And
that
was
built
by
two
guys
in
Oslo
I
guess
the
answer
is
that
we
don
t
know
what
will
work
or
not
but
we
re
thrilled
that
people
want
to
innovate
around
it

So
do
you
still
find
time
to
play
guitar
Ek
Laughs
I
do
I
actually
bought
a
travel
guitar
and
that
guitar
is
really
cool
You
can
actually
fold
the
guitar
and
you
can
plug
headphones
into
it
but
it
s
acoustic
or
semi
acoustic
So
I
do
more
actually
than
I
did
last
year

Boston
Music
Hack
Day
Approaches
Participants
at
Boston
Music
Hack
Day
2010
will
converge
to
create
operational
music
technologies
over
a
single
weekend
Photo
of
last
year
s
event
Rich
Orris
Hundreds
of
music
technologists
will
enter
Boston
Music
Hack
Day
this
weekend
and
okay
hundreds
of
technologists
will
leave
too
Before
they
do
they
ll
spend
an
action
packed
weekend
at
Microsoft
s
aptly
named
New
England
Research
and
Development
Center
NERD
inventing
building
and
presenting
music
apps
hardware
hacks
and
art
projects
The
official
rules
are
simple
Music
software
hardware
art
the
web
Anything
goes
as
long
as
it
s
music
related
Mere
mortals
such
as
myself
are
often
shocked
by
the
pace
of
innovation
these
days
which
is
mostly
due
to
the
dedication
ingenuity
and
yes
occasionally
genius
of
the
coders
and
makers
who
build
the
technology
we
use
every
day
Music
is
no
exception
At
Boston
Music
Hack
Day
on
October
16th
and
17th
you
can
literally
see
this
innovation
happen
either
in
person
or
through
a
live
video
stream
There
s
even
a
T
shirt
courtesy
of
a
crowdsourced
design
challenge
So
what
will
you
see
Lots
of
smart
people
building
the
next
generation
of
smart
music
applications
everything
from
powerful
listening
tools
you
might
use
every
day
to
completely
whimsical
creations
like
The
Swinger
created
at
San
Francisco
s
Music
Hack
Day
which
famously
enforced
a
swing
beat
on
hits
like
Guns
N
Roses
Sweet
Child
O
Mine
as
noted
by
Boing
Boing
and
others
Music
Hack
Days
where
technology
enthusiasts
gather
to
build
both
serious
creations
and
off
the
wall
apps
like
The
Swinger
have
sprung
up
in
many
of
the
world
s
tech
hotspots
since
the
first
event
was
held
in
London
last
July
The
previous
Boston
Music
Hack
Day
drew
over
350
software
wizards
hardware
tinkerers
and
members
of
the
press
eager
to
witness
the
creation
of
new
technologies
Designer
Jocelyn
Petko
of
Alburtis
Pennsylvania
won
the
24
hour
long
contest
to
design
the
T
shirt
for
Boston
Music
Hack
Day
with
this
design
On
Saturday
and
Sunday
participants
will
build
their
ideas
with
each
team
presenting
their
creations
on
Sunday
evening
in
the
hopes
of
winning
a
variety
of
prizes
Sponsors
of
the
event
include
Collecta
extensions
fm
Microsoft
NERD
MTV
Mozilla
MusiXMatch
SonicBids
SoundCloud
TicketFly
and
The
Echo
Nest
which
publishes
Evolver

Read
more
about
the
relationship
between
Evolver
fm
and
The
Echo
Nest
We
re
currently
witnessing
the
dawn
of
another
digital
music
revolution
as
the
media
player
migrates
from
hardware
to
software
more
specifically
to
web
and
mobile
apps
that
apply
powerful
data
APIs
to
innovative
ideas
that
would
never
be
feasible
on
a
pure
hardware
level
Hardware
interfaces
continue
to
be
important
but
because
MP3
players
can
be
code
now
they
have
the
potential
to
do
a
lot
more
than
they
could
just
a
few
years
ago
I
was
there
when
Steve
Jobs
announced
the
iPod
but
these
days
even
Steve
Jobs
knows
apps
are
where
the
action
is
I
m
not
the
only
one
looking
forward
to
seeing
this
year
s
creations
in
all
their
forms
Here
s
that
livestream
link
again
and
to
whet
your
appetite
some
more
photos
from
last
year
s
event
Stay
tuned

The
Story
My
designs
derive
from
an
imaginative
dark
fantasy
like
world
Drawing
inspiration
from
unfamiliar
elements
I
am
very
interested
in
human
beings
desire
to
use
symbolism
to
unify
progress
and
understand
the
elements
I
want
to
produce
symbols
of
strength
life
and
death
For
me
jewellery
enables
the
wearer
to
express
themselves
The
accessory
allows
a
level
of
detail
that
gives
the
wearer
an
extra
element
to
articulate
and
give
confidence
to
their
look
Shield
is
about
a
universal
expression
of
strength
with
form
I
wanted
to
create
and
emphasize
bold
shapes
and
angles
in
considered
pieces
The
inspiration
for
Shield
comes
from
living
in
the
city
This
environment
creates
a
strong
and
expressive
mood
I
want
this
collection
to
give
the
wearer
confidence
especially
in
such
uncertain
times

Curious
which
Oscar
nominated
animated
short
film
will
win
the
Academy
Award
on
February
26
Well
I
m
no
prognosticator
and
I
honestly
don
t
really
care
which
little
known
filmmaker
takes
home
the
golden
statue
But
I
am
happy
the
Oscars
exist
and
have
the
animated
short
category
because
it
means
that
moviegoers
have
at
least
one
chance
a
year
to
see
at
least
five
supposedly
exceptional
animated
shorts
in
the
theater
There
s
usually
at
least
one
in
the
bunch
I
m
not
that
in
love
with
but
even
4
out
of
5
makes
for
a
great
program
especially
when
the
best
films
are
really
something
special
And
maybe
you
like
the
Academy
will
enjoy
them
all
This
year
s
Oscar
nominated
shorts
will
be
released
to
theaters
this
Friday
February
10
I
ve
seen
all
five
of
the
animated
shorts
and
have
ranked
them
in
order
of
my
favor
below
with
review
and
preview
notes
1
La
Luna
I
know
it
s
somewhat
obvious
and
boring
to
name
a
Pixar
short
as
the
best
but
I
m
no
constant
Pixar
champion
I
do
think
they
produce
some
really
weak
ones
including
those
that
get
nominated
Boundin
for
example
and
anyway
they
don
t
win
all
the
time
In
fact
they
haven
t
won
the
Oscar
in
this
category
in
a
decade
Last
year
they
did
actually
deserve
it
with
the
clever
3D
piece
Day
Night
and
now
they
deserve
it
again
with
this
7
minute
Italo
Calvino
inspired
short
written
and
directed
by
Enrico
Casarosa
previously
a
story
artist
on
Cars
Ratatouille
and
Up
and
head
of
story
on
an
upcoming
Pixar
feature
So
what
makes
the
short
so
wonderful
It
s
the
most
basic
timeless
and
magical
kind
of
storytelling
and
cinematographically
with
its
blend
of
computer
animation
and
watercolor
pastel
backdrops
it
s
the
one
short
among
these
nominees
that
I
wish
I
d
seen
on
the
big
screen
I
still
can
I
suppose
It
features
three
generations
of
males
in
a
family
of
moon
sweepers
I
guess
I
shouldn
t
give
away
entirely
what
that
entails
but
it
involves
a
fresh
yet
familiar
kind
of
myth
about
the
moon
something
that
could
be
as
lasting
at
least
for
the
sake
of
children
s
wonder
as
the
lunar
deities
and
the
Man
in
the
Moon
With
its
kinship
to
Georges
Melies
A
Trip
to
the
Moon
I
think
this
is
to
Hugo
what
the
next
film
is
to
The
Artist
maybe
that
means
the
next
film
will
actually
win
Watch
the
trailer

The
Fantastic
Flying
Books
of
Mr
Morris
Lessmore
Keeping
somewhat
with
the
theme
of
celebrating
old
movies
this
hybrid
of
miniatures
computer
animation
and
2D
animation
fits
well
in
this
year
s
Academy
Awards
roster
The
15
minute
work
begins
in
New
Orleans
as
a
Katrina
like
storm
busts
through
the
French
Quarter
while
the
title
character
a
bit
of
a
mash
up
between
Buster
Keaton
and
Charlie
Chaplin
s
tramp
is
reading
a
book
Even
the
words
are
blown
off
the
pages
and
eventually
an
obvious
Wizard
of
Oz
allusion
brings
Mr
Morris
Lessmore
through
the
air
and
then
grounds
him
in
a
now
black
and
white
disaster
area
But
soon
the
playful
Katrina
stuff
is
gone
as
the
man
comes
across
a
house
filled
with
flying
clapping
piano
playing
life
giving
books
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
Think
of
it
somewhere
between
the
extremes
of
Disney
s
Alice
in
Wonderland
and
The
Pagemaster
with
a
touch
of
Pleasantville
thrown
in
While
I
appreciate
its
ability
to
tell
a
story
without
dialogue
I
think
it
helps
too
much
that
the
story
here
has
little
sense
or
reason
behind
it
And
is
it
saying
that
literature
will
fix
all
of
the
Big
Easy
s
problems
This
short
does
look
great
however
and
you
can
tell
this
film
is
written
and
directed
by
a
veteran
author
of
children
s
books
and
producer
of
animated
features
such
as
Louisiana
s
own
William
Joyce
who
has
worked
for
Pixar
Disney
Fox
Animation
and
now
for
an
upcoming
feature
adaptation
of
his
series
Guardians
of
Childhood
DreamWorks
Animation
Co
directed
by
Brandon
Oldenburg
a
conceptual
artist
who
previously
worked
with
Joyce
on
Robots

A
Morning
Stroll
Continuing
the
streak
of
relatively
dialogue
free
shorts
with
homage
to
old
cinema
this
is
an
amusing
cartoon
inspired
by
a
very
short
story
by
Linda
Elegant
titled
The
Chicken
which
is
allegedly
real
and
therefore
included
in
Paul
Auster
s
True
Tales
of
American
Life
also
posted
in
full
here
The
original
tale
simply
involves
the
sighting
of
a
chicken
on
what
seemed
to
be
an
independent
morning
stroll
down
the
street
and
up
to
its
residence
where
the
bird
knocked
on
the
door
and
was
subsequently
let
inside
In
only
7
minutes
Grant
Orchard
2003
s
Welcome
to
Glaringly
which
you
can
watch
here
expands
on
the
surreal
idea
with
three
separate
reenactments
in
three
different
time
periods
each
rendered
in
a
corresponding
animation
style
The
end
of
the
third
bit
provides
a
kind
of
punchline
for
the
whole
thing
after
climaxing
with
a
post
apocalyptic
zombie
attack
The
first
act
is
the
classic
cinema
tribute
in
that
it
s
very
simple
animation
presented
as
if
projected
with
old
timey
flicker
I
d
love
to
see
the
rest
of
Auster
s
crowd
sourced
collection
adapted
with
such
fun
and
inventive
bits
Watch
the
trailer

Wild
Life
I
m
sure
I
should
like
this
one
a
bit
more
than
I
do
And
I
actually
do
think
it
s
quite
good
but
it
s
directed
by
Amanda
Forbis
and
Wendy
Tilby
who
really
captivated
us
with
their
1999
Oscar
nominee
When
the
Day
Breaks
watch
that
one
here
Tilby
also
was
nominated
in
1992
for
Strings
which
I
also
find
stylishly
superior
watch
that
one
here
I
figure
this
sleepy
somber
western
tale
of
an
Englishman
trying
to
make
it
in
the
Wild
West
of
Alberta
in
1909
as
an
analogical
comet
flies
by
overhead
I
assume
it
s
meant
to
be
Halley
s
is
not
really
worthy
of
being
the
work
that
finally
gets
the
filmmakers
their
Academy
Award
unless
it
s
really
for
career
achievement
purposes
Watch
the
trailer
5
Dimanche
Sunday
My
least
favorite
of
the
five
is
this
crudely
drawn
and
slightly
morbid
tale
of
a
little
Canadian
boy
s
Sunday
which
consists
of
church
company
and
coins
the
last
of
which
he
flattens
on
the
railroad
tracks
Also
squashed
is
a
dog
run
over
by
his
family
car
and
what
appears
to
be
part
of
his
imagination
I
lost
interest
in
the
story
and
the
skewed
traditional
animation
quite
early
in
the
9
minute
short
which
was
directed
by
Patrick
Doyon
and
I
was
disappointed
that
it
didn
t
at
least
have
a
cheap
gag
thrown
in
at
the
end
I
m
just
as
upset
that
I
would
even
wish
for
such
a
thing

Never
exactly
the
finest
hour
of
the
Oscars
the
Best
Original
Song
category
of
the
Academy
Awards
this
year
has
been
something
of
a
fiasco
First
it
was
nominations
with
only
two
tracks
Man
or
Muppet
from
The
Muppets
and
Real
In
Rio
from
the
animated
film
Rio
making
the
cut
Then
at
the
start
of
this
week
Deadline
broke
the
news
that
neither
song
would
be
performed
as
part
of
the
Oscar
telecast
seemingly
in
the
ever
vain
hope
of
keeping
the
running
time
of
the
ceremony
under
three
hours
despite
protestations
from
those
behind
the
two
films
and
many
others
The
category
has
always
been
a
somewhat
extraneous
side
bar
but
at
its
best
think
Bj
rk
for
Dancer
in
the
Dark
Robin
Williams
leading
high
kicking
mounties
in
a
rendition
of
Blame
Canada
or
Glen
Hansard
and
Marketa
Inglova
performing
and
winning
for
Falling
Slowly
from
Once
it
can
provide
some
of
the
biggest
talking
points
of
the
night
The
move
not
to
honor
the
nominees
this
year
isn
t
unprecedented
they
were
also
skipped
two
years
ago
but
it
seems
to
signify
a
lack
of
confidence
in
the
category
from
the
Academy
and
a
possible
signifier
that
its
place
may
not
be
long
for
this
world
It
s
principally
the
fault
of
the
music
branch
s
new
voting
system
The
short
version
of
the
process
is
that
a
song
from
a
film
has
to
score
an
average
of
over
8
25
to
become
a
nominee
although
if
no
contenders
make
that
mark
the
two
highest
will
be
picked
which
may
well
have
been
the
case
this
year
It
s
the
worst
possible
system
and
will
hopefully
be
scrapped
in
future
years
But
assuming
the
branch
got
their
shit
together
were
there
any
worthier
nominees
than
the
two
rather
mediocre
ones
they
picked
Well
yes
in
fact
Below
we
ve
picked
out
five
original
songs
that
deserved
a
place
on
the
list
on
merit
alone
and
that
could
have
livened
up
the
Academy
Awards
broadcast
to
no
end
We
ve
kept
ourselves
to
eligible
songs
written
specifically
for
the
film
and
featuring
in
the
body
of
the
movie
or
as
the
first
song
in
the
end
credits
but
still
found
plenty
that
were
worthier
than
Real
In
Rio
Listen
to
our
picks
below
Life
s
A
Happy
Song
Jason
Segel
Amy
Adams
Walter
Feist
Mickey
Rooney
The
Muppets
While
The
Muppets
the
closest
thing
to
an
original
live
action
musical
we
ve
had
in
some
time
was
always
going
to
get
one
nomination
it
s
a
testament
to
the
songwriter
s
branch
that
they
somehow
managed
to
nominate
the
least
engaging
song
of
the
film
Man
Or
Muppet
is
sort
of
fun
but
how
do
you
resist
the
upbeat
catchy
charms
of
Life
s
A
Happy
Song
the
Bret
McKenzie
penned
opening
number
that
wasn
t
just
the
highlight
of
the
soundtrack
but
also
the
whole
film
It
s
an
earworm
it
s
got
big
laughs
puppets
a
solo
showcase
for
A
lister
Amy
Adams
and
even
the
opportunity
to
get
91
year
old
veteran
Mickey
Rooney
on
the
stage
for
his
one
line
cameo
Not
nominating
this
one
suggests
that
even
the
songwriters
branch
don
t
care
about
the
category
anymore
Hiding
Tonight
Alex
Turner
Submarine
At
least
for
this
one
the
actual
voters
can
t
be
blamed
for
whatever
reason
probably
the
film
s
less
than
stellar
box
office
performance
The
Weinstein
Company
seemingly
chose
not
to
submit
any
of
Arctic
Monkeys
frontman
Alex
Turner
s
six
original
compositions
that
make
up
the
soundtrack
to
Richard
Ayoade
s
charming
debut
for
consideration
It
s
an
awful
shame
as
no
picture
this
year
so
closely
interweaved
its
song
score
with
the
film
which
is
meant
to
be
the
point
of
the
category
Turner
who
s
still
a
mere
26
is
one
of
the
most
gifted
songwriters
of
his
generation
melding
melody
with
incisive
witty
lyrics
and
the
swooning
Hiding
Tonight
is
the
highlight
of
his
work
on
Submarine
although
really
any
of
the
tunes
could
have
made
the
cut
Think
You
Can
Wait
The
National
ft
Sharon
Van
Etten
Win
Win
This
one
caused
a
little
internal
debate
but
even
The
Playlist
s
head
honchos
who
are
less
enamored
of
The
National
s
brand
of
muscular
Springsteen
indebted
rock
than
this
writer
had
to
admit
that
their
contribution
to
Tom
McCarthy
s
Win
Win
was
more
deserving
of
a
nomination
than
95
of
the
field
A
trademark
ballad
of
male
inadequacy
and
self
destruction
featuring
backing
vocals
by
Brooklyn
singer
songwriter
Sharon
Van
Etten
it
s
a
beautiful
little
number
and
given
how
huge
the
band
have
gotten
these
days
could
have
made
for
a
performance
that
helped
bring
in
new
viewers
to
the
telecast
Maybe
it
was
the
placement
of
the
film
s
end
credits
that
did
it
in
but
alas
we
ll
never
know
Hanna
s
Theme
The
Chemical
Brothers
ft
Stephanie
Dosen
Hanna
Another
one
never
submitted
for
consideration
this
is
the
sole
vocal
track
from
Chemical
Brothers
score
for
Joe
Wright
s
pop
art
actioner
Hanna
Featuring
haunting
vocals
from
singer
songwriter
and
occasional
Massive
Attack
member
Stephanie
Dosen
it
s
a
neat
crystalization
of
the
childlike
fairy
tale
feel
of
both
the
film
But
if
you
re
looking
to
get
on
the
dancefllor
the
score
isn
t
afraid
to
unleash
some
block
rocking
beats
when
needed
There
s
basically
no
precedent
for
something
of
this
sort
being
nominated
and
performed
at
the
show
but
you
can
t
say
it
wouldn
t
have
livened
things
up
and
it
certainly
deserves
it
on
merit
Note
the
video
below
is
not
official
but
the
only
embed
we
could
find
that
wouldn
t
make
you
jump
to
YouTube
to
hear
it
Shelter
Ben
Nichols
Take
Shelter
Ok
so
Take
Shelter
isn
t
exactly
the
kind
of
movie
that
the
Best
Original
Song
category
usually
features
and
neither
is
Shelter
the
theme
tune
by
Ben
Nichols
frontman
of
Memphis
band
Lucero
But
then
it
s
only
two
years
since
The
Weary
Kind
from
Crazy
Heart
won
the
Oscar
and
last
year
saw
Country
Strong
from
Country
Strong
nominated
so
it
s
not
inconceivable
for
something
like
this
to
be
featured
and
Nichols
acoustic
country
tinged
ballad
is
a
far
more
robust
song
than
most
of
the
nominations
and
certainly
more
interesting
than
those
from
bigger
stars
like
Mary
J
Blige
and
Chris
Cornell
Plus
with
Michael
Shannon
missing
out
on
an
actor
nomination
it
would
have
been
a
nice
bit
of
exposure
for
a
film
that
needed
more
Also
Worthy
Star
Spangled
Man
from
Captain
America
The
First
Avenger
comes
from
multiple
nominee
Alan
Menken
and
would
have
made
a
pretty
impressive
production
number
while
Zaz
s
Coeur
Valant
from
Hugo
was
a
pretty
little
French
tune
that
could
have
brought
a
little
international
flavor
Meanwhile
Elvis
Costello
She
Him
and
J
ns
i
also
had
songs
from
respectively
One
Day
Winnie
The
Pooh
and
We
Bought
a
Zoo
that
while
far
from
their
best
work
are
more
deserving
than
Real
In
Rio
Speaking
of
if
they
were
going
to
nominate
a
song
from
Rio
why
not
highlight
Pretty
Bird
a
genuinely
funny
showcase
for
the
film
s
villain
Nigel
voiced
by
Jemaine
Clement
Which
if
nothing
else
would
have
made
the
category
a
showdown
between
the
two
members
of
Flight
of
the
Conchords
Finally
if
Three
Six
Mafia
can
win
for

To
be
honest
the
Best
Song
category
was
always
the
least
one
I
cared
about
and
more
often
than
not
the
songs
nominated
were
a
drag
to
sit
through
save
for
the
song
from
Once
which
was
a
delight
If
they
got
rid
of
this
category
all
together
I
wouldn
t
mind
it
a
bit
leaves
more
room
for
funny
skits
Let

Meyer
Ever
since
Lionsgate
swooped
in
a
bought
Summit
the
biggest
question
has
been
what
their
plans
are
for
the
latter
s
biggest
franchise
and
most
valuable
asset
the
Twilight
films
Last
month
Lionsgate
chief
Jon
Feltheimer
said
Boy
I
hope
so
when
asked
if
the
lucrative
series
would
continue
past
the
final
film
Breaking
Dawn
Part
2
when
it
arrives
this
fall
And
it
might
Lionsgate
motion
picture
group
co
chair
Rob
Friedman
was
asked
by
THR
about
the
possibility
of
a
6th
film
and
he
said
if
the
material
is
there
in
another
book
it
will
happen
If
she
Meyer
wishes
to
do
it
we
ll
be
there
to
support
her
he
said
Messageboards
all
over
the
world
are
now
in
meltdown
But
really
there
is
probably
no
doubt
that
Lionsgate
wants
to
find
a
way
to
keep
the
money
for
Summit
s
biggest
cashcow
flowing
To
date
the
series
has
raked
in
over
1
billion
worldwide
at
the
box
office
and
that
s
not
counting
merchandise
books
and
other
ephemera
And
the
studio
is
estimating
hoping
that
the
finale
Breaking
Dawn
2
will
add
700
million
to
the
bank
an
ambitious
overestimate
considering
it
would
have
to
do
150
more
business
than
Breaking
Dawn
Part
1
But
either
way
Lionsgate
has
dollar
signs
in
their
eyes
and
we
wouldn
t
be
surprised
if
they
ve
already
put
feelers
out
to
Meyer
to
see
what
her
feelings
are
about
returning
to
Forks
Washington
So
Twihards
say
a
prayer
under
your
Edward
or
Jacob
poster
tonight
The
story
may
not
be
over

Financial
success
doesn
t
just
happen
you
have
to
plan
for
it
A
spending
plan
can
help
you
allocate
your
money
resources
to
the
financial
goals
that
will
provide
you
with
a
secure
future
as
well
as
help
you
enjoy
your
life
right
now
When
your
Financial
success
doesn
t
just
happen
you
have
to
plan
for
it
A
spending
plan
can
help
you
allocate
your
money
resources
to
the
financial
goals
that
will
provide
you
with
a
secure
future
as
well
as
help
you
enjoy
your
life
right
now
When
your
family
creates
a
spending
plan
you
take
control
of
your
financial
destiny
and
play
an
active
role
in
what
happens
to
your
family
next
Deciding
on
your
values
priorities
and
goals
The
first
thing
to
determine
is
what
your
shared
values
priorities
and
goals
are
as
a
family
Your
spending
plan
should
help
you
to
live
the
life
you
want
not
to
be
a
carbon
copy
of
some
other
family
s
life
and
priorities
Talk
about
what
you
value
as
a
family
This
could
be
spending
time
together
at
home
going
on
the
occasional
vacation
giving
to
charity
performing
service
supporting
extracurricular
activities
or
buying
a
new
big
screen
TV
Realize
that
there
are
no
wrong
answers
Decide
what
defines
you
as
a
family
and
set
goals
together
Then
decide
which
goals
should
take
priority
If
your
family
wants
to
become
obligation
free
then
a
plan
to
pay
off
debt
should
be
the
number
one
priority
If
you
want
to
save
up
for
a
down
payment
on
a
house
set
a
timeframe
and
put
your
savings
toward
that
goal
Allocating
your
financial
resources
Once
you
understand
your
family
s
goals
it
s
time
to
figure
out
how
to
allocate
your
resources
Of
course
you
will
first
need
to
cover
expenses
like
housing
payments
groceries
clothing
utilities
and
insurance
Then
look
at
how
much
each
month
can
realistically
go
toward
helping
your
family
accomplish
its
goals
Prioritize
your
savings
so
you
will
be
able
to
achieve
your
short
term
and
long
term
goals
While
you
might
want
to
start
saving
for
retirement
your
bigger
priority
might
be
paying
down
debt
Put
more
of
your
resources
toward
debt
reduction
for
now
but
don
t
neglect
the
long
term
goal
of
retirement
savings
As
you
get
rid
of
debt
you
can
shift
your
money
toward
funding
retirement
Prioritize
your
spending
so
that
the
most
important
items
are
paid
for
first
Knowing
your
priorities
ahead
of
time
makes
it
less
painful
to
make
budget
cuts
because
you
can
start
by
cutting
the
items
off
the
bottom
of
your
list
For
example
your
family
might
be
saving
money
for
a
vacation
You
determine
that
150
a
month
needs
to
be
set
aside
for
the
next
10
months
but
you
might
not
have
enough
money
to
do
everything
else
you
want
You
might
need
to
drop
off
some
of
the
less
important
expenses
such
as
going
to
the
movies
or
buying
a
new
iPad
Earning
more
Your
spending
plan
doesn
t
just
have
to
be
about
figuring
out
where
to
cut
back
on
spending
Involve
every
member
of
the
family
in
discussing
what
can
be
done
to
contribute
to
the
accomplishment
of
family
goals
whether
it
s
cutting
back
on
less
important
spending
or
doing
odd
jobs
to
help
boost
the
family
income
Mark
your
progress
toward
your
goals
and
find
ways
to
celebrate
as
you
accomplish
your
objectives
And
as
you
achieve
your
current
goals
remember
to
adjust
your
spending
plan
so
that
your
newly
freed
financial
resources
can
shift
to
fund
the
next
adventure

My
name
is
Miranda
Marquit
and
I
m
a
personal
finance
advice
blogger
I
have
a
passion
for
finance
especially
as
it
relates
to
helping
ordinary

build

and

according

My
name
is
Miranda
Marquit
and
I
m
a
personal
finance
advice
blogger
I
have
a
passion
for
finance
especially
as
it
relates
to
helping
ordinary
families
build
wealth
and
direct
their
resources
according
to
their
own
values
and
priorities
When
I
write
about
family
finance
I
like
to
focus
on
the
ways
you
can
use
your
financial
resources
to
build
the
life
you
want
for
your
family
For
the
most
part
I
believe
that
focusing
on
improving
your
ability
to
earn
money
as
well
as
making
spending
choices
that
reflect
your
own
goals
can
do
this
While
I
believe
that
saving
money
is
important
and
that
you
should
get
the
best
value
for
your
dollar
I
don
t
often
write
about
pinching
pennies
I
m
more
about
looking
for
ways
to
create
the
lifestyle
you
want
by
identifying
your
values
and
priorities
and
then
allocating
your
money
in
a
way
that
reflects
what
s
most
important
to
you
Identifying
your
goals
and
looking
to
the
future
Whether
your
goals
are
to
build
a
retirement
nest
egg
create
passive
income
dig
out
of
a
debt
hole
pay
for
your
children
to
attend
college
save
for
a
down
payment
on
a
new
home
create
a
fully
funded
emergency
account
or
travel
the
world
only
you
can
determine
the
life
you
want
to
live
There
are
strategies
you
can
follow
to
ensure
that
you
can
afford
the
things
that
are
most
important
to
you
at
each
of
your
family
s
milestones
This
type
of
planning
requires
a
long
term
view
as
well
as
the
ability
to
honestly
evaluate
your
current
situation
and
identify
your
goals
I
hope
my
posts
will
inspire
you
to
create
your
own
financial
road
map
based
on
your
family
s
values
My
posts
will
include
some
of
the
actions
my
family
is
taking
right
now
as
well
as
actions
we
hope
to
take
in
the
future
Additionally
I
will
look
at
how
your
family
relationships
can
affect
the
way
you
interact
with
money
and
how
you
set
priorities
as
a
family
especially
if
you
sometimes
want
different
things
or
have
different
approaches
to
money
Why
should
you
read
what
I
have
to
say
I
ve
made
my
share
of
mistakes
in
life
when
it
comes
to
finances
I
dug
out
from
credit
card
debt
amassed
at
college
and
I
m
still
recovering
in
some
ways
from
earlier
financial
missteps
However
10
years
after
my
marriage
started
with
debt
I
have
a
M
A
in
journalism
from
Syracuse
University
my
husband
has
completed
his
Ph
D
and
my
family
is
able
to
meet
all
of
our
needs
and
most
of
our
wants
I
ve
learned
tough
financial
lessons
through
experience
On
top
of
that
I
ve
had
the
opportunity
to
research
different
financial
and
investing
strategies
as
part
of
my
career
as
a
finance
writer
I
write
for
a
variety
of
financial
websites
on
subjects
ranging
from
investing
to
business
to
personal
and
family
finance
My
work
has
appeared
in
been
mentioned
by
and
linked
from
major
news
websites
including
The
New
York
Times
The
Washington
Post
USA
Today
The
Consumerist
The
Atlantic
Wire
and
The
Huffington
Post
I
am
lucky
to
work
from
home
doing
something
I
love
and
I
m

The
annual
Auto
Show
is
coming
to
Chicago
this
weekend
as
it
begins
to
make
the
rounds
nationally
and
car
manufacturers
will
be
offering
deals
to
tempt
you
into
buying
the
newest
model
According
to
the
National
Automotive
Dealers
Association
NADA
new
cars
are
now
selling
at
the
highest
prices
in
years
as
demand
improves
Higher
prices
mean
you
might
have
to
think
carefully
about
what
options
and
features
will
fit
into
your
budget
If
you
re
looking
at
luxury
models
be
prepared
for
insurance
sticker
price
shock
Some
luxury
cars
will
hike
your
auto
insurance
premium
However
other
luxury
cars
are
much
cheaper
to
insure
If
you
re
looking
to
buy
a
new
car
saving
money
on
your
auto
insurance
premium
should
be
a
factor
in
your
decision
For
families
the
Toyota
Sienna
LE
minivan
is
a
steal
as
the
least
expensive
2012
model
vehicle
for
auto
insurance
according
to
Insure
com
Minivans
have
always
had
a
strong
showing
in
our
least
expensive
rankings
said
Amy
Danise
of
Insure
com
They
regularly
prove
to
be
safe
economical
vehicles
Toyota
takes
the
top
two
spots
for
least
expensive
cars
to
insure
with
the
Sienna
LE
and
the
Sienna
4
cyl
Jeep
takes
the
next
two
spots
with
the
Patriot
Sport
and
the
Jeep
Compass
Sport
If
you
re
looking
for
a
pickup
truck
your
wallet
is
safe
The
GMC
Sierra
K1500
Regular
Cab
takes
the
fifth
spot
for
least
expensive
vehicle
to
insure
If
you
re
looking
for
something
a
bit
sportier
it
s
going
to
cost
you
The
2012
Audi
Spyder
Quattro
a
two
set
V10
convertible
is
the
most
expensive
car
to
insure
this
year
Audi
Mercedes
and
Porsche
take
the
top
five
slots
for
most
expensive
cars
to
insure
The
flash
factor
isn
t
the
only
criteria
when
insurance
companies
are
looking
at
your
car
Underwriters
take
into
consideration
the
frequency
of
crashes
for
that
model
the
cost
of
repairs
the
cost
to
insurers
when
a
vehicle
is
declared
a
total
loss
and
the
cost
of
bodily
injury
claims
The
make
and
model
can
push
an
auto
insurance
quote
higher
or
lower
but
there
are
things
you
can
do
save
money
on
your
auto
insurance
premiums
Install
Safety
Features
If
safety
features
aren
t
included
in
the
basic
model
shell
out
the
extra
cash
to
have
safety
features
installed
You
ll
be
more
secure
on
the
road
and
some
insurance
companies
give
discounts
for
safety
related
items
like
air
bags
anti
lock
brakes
and
anti
theft
devices
Raise
Your
Deductible
Consider
raising
the
deductible
on
new
cars
on
your
auto
insurance
policy
If
you
re
willing
to
pay
more
out
of
pocket
to
repair
a
new
car
you
ll
save
more
money
When
your
cars
are
a
few
years
old
you
can
reduce
the
coverage
These
cars
have
a
lower
market
value
and
any
money
you
get
from
a
claim
probably
won
t
be
more
than
the
cost
of
the
insurance
and
deductible
Bundle
Insurance
Policies
Insurance
companies
want
all
of
your
business
Ask
your
insurance
agent
what
kind
of
discount
is
available
if
you
bundle
your
homeowners
and
auto
insurance
plans
Are
you
renting
You
can
usually
save
money
on
your
auto
insurance
if
you
bundle
your
policy
with
a
renter
s
policy

Sorting
Out
Sales
Tax
and
Nexus
February
6th
2012
by
Shane
Ratigan
A
sales
tax
is
an
excise
tax
on
transactions
Traditionally
the
types
of
transactions
where
a
state
could
demand
sales
tax
collection
were
easy
to
identify
Typical
transactions
in
the
last
century
were
remarkably
localized
compared
to
modern
commercial
channels
Cross
border
transactions
were
the
exception
Today
cross
border
transactions
are
the
norm
Vendors
of
all
sizes
and
all
niches
are
likely
to
engage
in
business
transactions
with
parties
all
over
the
United
States
and
perhaps
the
world
The
elimination
of
borders
as
a
barrier
to
trade
places
particular
emphasis
on
the
essential
question
Which
vendors
are
compelled
to
collect
sales
taxes
In
this
arena
one
very
important
legal
principle
always
takes
center
stage
nexus
In
the
legal
sense
nexus
describes
the
connection
between
two
or
more
participants
interests
or
concepts
In
the
world
of
sales
tax
nexus
refers
to
the
connection
a
retailer
has
with
a
state
Nexus
is
the
legal
connection
that
empowers
a
state
to
demand
collection
and
remittance
of
a
retail
sales
tax
The
U
S
Supreme
Court
developed
its
core
concept
of
nexus
in
the
field
of
taxation
more
than
125
years
ago
The
power
of
taxation
however
vast
in
its
character
and
searching
in
its
extent
is
necessarily
limited
to
subjects
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
State
These
subjects
are
persons
property
and
business
Whatever
form
taxation
may
assume
whether
as
duties
imports
excises
or
licenses
it
must
relate
to
one
of
these
subjects
Cleveland
v
Penn
82
US
179
186
1873
More
recently
the
Court
gave
us
one
deceptively
simple
bright
line
nexus
rule
in
1992
a
seller
whose
only
connection
with
customers
in
the
State
is
by
common
carrier
or
the
United
States
mail
lack
s
the
requisite
minimum
contacts
with
the
State
Quill
v
N
D
112
S
Ct
1904
1992
This
bright
line
rule
for
sales
tax
nexus
is
presented
in
the
negative
The
Quill
rule
instructs
a
vendor
what
is
not
nexus
but
it
leaves
a
vendor
empty
handed
if
it
is
looking
for
exactly
what
is
nexus
constitutionally
speaking
of
course
The
Court
has
its
own
reasons
for
avoiding
specifics
in
this
area
because
it
believes
the
rules
of
sales
tax
collection
between
the
states
falls
confidently
on
the
U
S
Congress
to
figure
out
Where
does
this
leave
us
Since
states
are
eager
to
require
collection
and
remittance
many
have
taken
steps
to
expand
their
definition
of
nexus
by
regulatory
and
policy
efforts
However
the
limited
utility
of
the
Quill
decision
left
them
plenty
of
room
for
creativity
A
Few
of
the
Ways
States
Try
to
Compel
Collection
and
Remittance
Recently
states
have
developed
and
tested
legal
theories
in
order
to
push
the
boundaries
of
nexus
Some
have
met
with
success
and
some
have
not
most
disconcerting
however
is
that
some
theories
are
still
being
vetted
in
state
and
federal
courthouses
Attributional
Affiliate
Nexus
Amazon
Laws
The
expansion
of
the
affiliate
concept
is
currently
being
pushed
by
a
few
states
New
York
has
had
success
defending
its
so
called
Amazon
Law
with
the
following
affiliate
definition
of
nexus
an
affiliated
person
that
is
a
vendor
as
otherwise
defined
in
this
paragraph
uses
in
the
state
trademarks
service
marks
or
trade
names
that
are
the
same
as
those
the
seller
uses
or
II
an
affiliated
person
engages
in
activities
in
the
state
that
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
seller
in
its
development
or
maintenance
of
a
market
for
its
goods
or
services
in
the
state
N
Y
Tax
Law
1101
b
8
i
I
These
laws
are
directed
at
Internet
based
vendors
who
use
affiliate
advertisements
The
ads
appear
on
web
pages
based
on
servers
in
New
York
State
Under
these
circumstances
the
court
stated
Amazon
s
lack
of
control
over
the
web
page
owners
did
not
preclude
the
state
from
enforcing
collection
on
the
Internet
vendor
The
Amazon
law
opens
the
door
for
states
to
require
sales
tax
collection
in
situations
where
a
company
has
only
limited
commercial
activities
within
a
state
As
Internet
marketing
becomes
more
complex
and
entangled
there
are
more
opportunities
for
otherwise
remote
activities
to
trigger
sales
tax
nexus
in
a
given
state
In
State
Representatives
It
seems
intuitive
that
paid
representatives
in
a
state
will
trigger
nexus
However
the
use
of
independentcontractors
and
sales
representatives
performing
significant
activities
in
a
state
has
generally
been
held
to
create
nexus
An
independent
representative
need
not
even
be
paid
in
some
states
in
order
to
trigger
nexus
Occasional
or
Minimum
Presence
In
general
permanence
is
not
a
required
element
for
the
nexus
analysis
In
fact
many
courts
find
nexus
either
through
existence
of
property
or
agents
of
the
vendor
For
example
the
N
Y
Court
of
Appeals
declared
that
while
a
physical
presence
of
the
vendor
is
required
it
need
not
be
substantial
Rather
it
must
be
demonstrably
more
than
a
slightest
presence

Otherwise
innocuous
instances
of
a
vendor
s
presence
such
as
deliveries
installation
or
occasional
service
calls
can
trigger
nexus
Transactional
Nexus
Any
office
in
a
state
can
trigger
nexus
Even
sales
entirely
unrelated
to
the
in
state
presence
of
a
vendor
s
employees
are
subject
to
sales
tax
collection
For
example
a
mail
order
company
with
an
advertising
office
in
state
even
where
that
office
is
entirely
unrelated
to
the
mail
order
business
is
still
required
to
collect
on
mail
order
sales
If
your
clients
have
business
in
more
than
one
state
nexus
laws
affect
them
Don
t
be
caught
unaware
Keep
up
with
sales
tax
laws
so
your
clients
can
rest
easy

Sorting
Out
Sales
Tax
and
Nexus
February
6th
2012
by
Shane
Ratigan
A
sales
tax
is
an
excise
tax
on
transactions
Traditionally
the
types
of
transactions
where
a
state
could
demand
sales
tax
collection
were
easy
to
identify
Typical
transactions
in
the
last
century
were
remarkably
localized
compared
to
modern
commercial
channels
Cross
border
transactions
were
the
exception
Today
cross
border
transactions
are
the
norm
Vendors
of
all
sizes
and
all
niches
are
likely
to
engage
in
business
transactions
with
parties
all
over
the
United
States
and
perhaps
the
world
The
elimination
of
borders
as
a
barrier
to
trade
places
particular
emphasis
on
the
essential
question
Which
vendors
are
compelled
to
collect
sales
taxes
In
this
arena
one
very
important
legal
principle
always
takes
center
stage
nexus
In
the
legal
sense
nexus
describes
the
connection
between
two
or
more
participants
interests
or
concepts
In
the
world
of
sales
tax
nexus
refers
to
the
connection
a
retailer
has
with
a
state
Nexus
is
the
legal
connection
that
empowers
a
state
to
demand
collection
and
remittance
of
a
retail
sales
tax
The
U
S
Supreme
Court
developed
its
core
concept
of
nexus
in
the
field
of
taxation
more
than
125
years
ago
The
power
of
taxation
however
vast
in
its
character
and
searching
in
its
extent
is
necessarily
limited
to
subjects
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
State
These
subjects
are
persons
property
and
business
Whatever
form
taxation
may
assume
whether
as
duties
imports
excises
or
licenses
it
must
relate
to
one
of
these
subjects
Cleveland
v
Penn
82
US
179
186
1873
More
recently
the
Court
gave
us
one
deceptively
simple
bright
line
nexus
rule
in
1992
a
seller
whose
only
connection
with
customers
in
the
State
is
by
common
carrier
or
the
United
States
mail
lack
s
the
requisite
minimum
contacts
with
the
State
Quill
v
N
D
112
S
Ct
1904
1992
This
bright
line
rule
for
sales
tax
nexus
is
presented
in
the
negative
The
Quill
rule
instructs
a
vendor
what
is
not
nexus
but
it
leaves
a
vendor
empty
handed
if
it
is
looking
for
exactly
what
is
nexus
constitutionally
speaking
of
course
The
Court
has
its
own
reasons
for
avoiding
specifics
in
this
area
because
it
believes
the
rules
of
sales
tax
collection
between
the
states
falls
confidently
on
the
U
S
Congress
to
figure
out
Where
does
this
leave
us
Since
states
are
eager
to
require
collection
and
remittance
many
have
taken
steps
to
expand
their
definition
of
nexus
by
regulatory
and
policy
efforts
However
the
limited
utility
of
the
Quill
decision
left
them
plenty
of
room
for
creativity
A
Few
of
the
Ways
States
Try
to
Compel
Collection
and
Remittance
Recently
states
have
developed
and
tested
legal
theories
in
order
to
push
the
boundaries
of
nexus
Some
have
met
with
success
and
some
have
not
most
disconcerting
however
is
that
some
theories
are
still
being
vetted
in
state
and
federal
courthouses
Attributional
Affiliate
Nexus
Amazon
Laws
The
expansion
of
the
affiliate
concept
is
currently
being
pushed
by
a
few
states
New
York
has
had
success
defending
its
so
called
Amazon
Law
with
the
following
affiliate
definition
of
nexus
an
affiliated
person
that
is
a
vendor
as
otherwise
defined
in
this
paragraph
uses
in
the
state
trademarks
service
marks
or
trade
names
that
are
the
same
as
those
the
seller
uses
or
II
an
affiliated
person
engages
in
activities
in
the
state
that
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
seller
in
its
development
or
maintenance
of
a
market
for
its
goods
or
services
in
the
state
N
Y
Tax
Law
1101
b
8
i
I
These
laws
are
directed
at
Internet
based
vendors
who
use
affiliate
advertisements
The
ads
appear
on
web
pages
based
on
servers
in
New
York
State
Under
these
circumstances
the
court
stated
Amazon
s
lack
of
control
over
the
web
page
owners
did
not
preclude
the
state
from
enforcing
collection
on
the
Internet
vendor
The
Amazon
law
opens
the
door
for
states
to
require
sales
tax
collection
in
situations
where
a
company
has
only
limited
commercial
activities
within
a
state
As
Internet
marketing
becomes
more
complex
and
entangled
there
are
more
opportunities
for
otherwise
remote
activities
to
trigger
sales
tax
nexus
in
a
given
state
In
State
Representatives
It
seems
intuitive
that
paid
representatives
in
a
state
will
trigger
nexus
However
the
use
of
independentcontractors
and
sales
representatives
performing
significant
activities
in
a
state
has
generally
been
held
to
create
nexus
An
independent
representative
need
not
even
be
paid
in
some
states
in
order
to
trigger
nexus
Occasional
or
Minimum
Presence
In
general
permanence
is
not
a
required
element
for
the
nexus
analysis
In
fact
many
courts
find
nexus
either
through
existence
of
property
or
agents
of
the
vendor
For
example
the
N
Y
Court
of
Appeals
declared
that
while
a
physical
presence
of
the
vendor
is
required
it
need
not
be
substantial
Rather
it
must
be
demonstrably
more
than
a
slightest
presence

Otherwise
innocuous
instances
of
a
vendor
s
presence
such
as
deliveries
installation
or
occasional
service
calls
can
trigger
nexus
Transactional
Nexus
Any
office
in
a
state
can
trigger
nexus
Even
sales
entirely
unrelated
to
the
in
state
presence
of
a
vendor
s
employees
are
subject
to
sales
tax
collection
For
example
a
mail
order
company
with
an
advertising
office
in
state
even
where
that
office
is
entirely
unrelated
to
the
mail
order
business
is
still
required
to
collect
on
mail
order
sales
If
your
clients
have
business
in
more
than
one
state
nexus
laws
affect
them
Don
t
be
caught
unaware
Keep
up
with
sales
tax
laws
so
your
clients
can
rest
easy

It
s
tax
season
and
that
means
your
time
is
at
a
premium
Sometimes
the
last
thing
a
tax
preparer
wants
to
do
is
spend
time
on
the
phone
getting
answers
to
complicated
questions
especially
if
the
answers
are
available
at
the
click
of
a
mouse
Welcome
to
Ask
Lacerte
and
Ask
ProSeries
two
search
self
service
pages
that
feature
one
click
access
to
many
of
the
most
popular
questions
we
get
on
our
phone
support
calls
or
through
online
searches
The
beauty
of
Ask
Lacerte
and
Ask
ProSeries
is
that
we
ve
anticipated
your
questions
and
as
a
result
we
provide
the
answers
you
need
right
now
Here
are
our

However
when

is
short

It
s
tax
season
and
that
means
your
time
is
at
a
premium
Sometimes
the
last
thing
a
tax
preparer
wants
to
do
is
spend
time
on
the
phone
getting
answers
to
complicated
questions
especially
if
the
answers
are
available
at
the
click
of
a
mouse
Welcome
to
Ask
Lacerte
and
Ask
ProSeries
two
search
self

that
feature
one
click
access
to
many
of
the
most
popular

we
get
on
our
phone
support

or

beauty
of

we

anticipated

and
as
a
result
we
provide
the

a
few
of
the
things

Thanks
Okay

Re

That

I

of

Some
of
your

recently
have
a
different
line
quality
about
them
as
though
they
re
hand
drawn
rather
than
vector
drawn
Have
you
been
doing
something
different
or
is
it

edit
on
second
thought
your
other

don
t
look
vector

I
dunno
but
something
looks

It
works
really
well
because
the

are
of
of
a

rather
than
being
set
up
as
a
gradient
which
makes
it
much

for

since
they

out
to
an

size

rather

Re

This
shirt
has
no
connection
to
the
topic
at
all
A
badger
is
one
of
the
four
mascots
of
the
Hogwarts
houses
The
fact
that
it
s
eating
the
snake
is
weird
it
makes
no
sense
at
all
but
that
doesn
t
put
it
on
topic
If
drinking
is
bitter
change
yourself
to
wine

Maria

Champagne
is
a
very
kind
and
friendly
thing
on
a

night

67
5
degrees
for

and
solid
colored
areas
I
use
a

for
shading
I
use
a
line
halftone
I
find
that
keeping
it
uniform
makes
things
look

cleaner
in
general

it
is
that
when
printed
it
doesn
t
look
like
dots
or
lines
but
sort
of
blends
to
some
degree
with
the
color
underneath
to
create
a
really
convincing
shading
effect
where
the
halftone
is
almost
imperceptible
edit
I
went
back
through
the
show
us
your
woot
thread
to
see
if
there
were
any
photos
from
other
times
I
used
this
technique
The
best
example
I
could
find
there
was
from
my
school
design
where
I
used
this
to
shade
all
the
turtle
shells
the
colors
are
a
little
bright
from
the
flash
in
this
photo
but
you
can
clearly
see
how
the
shading
comes
out
really
smooth
looking
as
though
another
color
were
used
Line
halftones
especially
when
properly
placed
can
really
play
tricks
on
your
eyes
and
create
great
shading
effects
without
getting
excessively
small

NP
when
I
first
started
I
had
no
idea
what
halftones
even
were
In
one
of
my
earlier
designs
I
actually
drew
in
diamonds
by
hand
to
create
a
halftone
like
effect
because
I
had
no
idea
how
people
were
creating
them
One
of
the
artists
on
the
site
at
the
time
graciously
explained
to
me
how
to
do
it
after
that
point
so
I
m
glad
to
be
able
to
help
people
with
it
now
that
I
ve
been
doing
it
for
more
than
3
years
and
have
a
lot
more
practice

I

you
use
the
varied

halftoning
for
the
background
which
is
what

That

And

Re

Thank
you
very
much
for
the
information
on
how
you
do
your
halftones
For
me
it
has
been
one
of
the
hardest
things
to
learn
how
to
make
look
good
at
all
If
you
don

in

what
is
the
LPI
on
the
shading
Thanks
again

Re

I
m
not
sure
what
everyone
is
complaining
about
It
makes
complete
sense
The
hufflepuff
which
is
a
badger
is
eating
what
most
people
think
would
be
gross
So
yeah
lions
eat
other
animals
as
well
as
snakes
Its
just
unusual
and
awkward
that
it
is
eating
another
hogwarts
crest
which
I
think
is
awkward
Your

saying
this

is
not

I
think
this
shirt
is

and
I

Diana
The

day
when
I

I
almost
commented
that
it
was
not
very
on
topic
because
I
thought
it
was
a
regular
badger
which
wouldn

be
out

place
at
Hogwarts
duh
Then
I
saw
ramy
s
first
comment
about
the
honey
badger
and
it
all
made
sense
Honey
badger
definitely
don
t
fit
in
at
Hogwarts
but
HONEY
BADGER
DON
T
CARE
The
goodness
of
the
true
pun
is
in
the
direct

of
its
intolerability

The
fact
that
this
is
a
Harry
Potter
shirt
makes
it
more
on
topic
for
me
The
honey
badge
isn
t
a
badger
and
also
isn
t
acting
like
all
of
the
other
mascots
which
seem
to
be
acting
like
students
It
s
not
the
strongest
of
fish
out
of
water
themed
shirts
but
I
think
it
fits
This
is
the
only
counterargument
to
mine
that
is
at
all
logical
And
I
retract
my
off
topic
post
If
it
is
indeed
identifiable
as
a
honey
badger
then
it
is
on
topic
Thanks
for
clarifying
the
differences
I
still
think
the
shirt
is
BS
but
it
is
on
theme
If
drinking
is
bitter
change
yourself
to
wine
Rainer
Maria
Rilke
Champagne
is
a
very
kind
and
friendly
thing
on
a
rainy
night

Dinesen
There
are
many
ways
to
the
recognition
of
truth
Burgundy
is
one
of
them

you

First

ok
fine
I
won

that

But
the
just

what
gets
me
I
have
had
one
other
design
that
could
possibly
be
defined
as
cutesy
since
the
start
of
this
year
which
ended
in
16th
place
So
far
this
year
I
ve
had
two
designs
that
printed
one
of
which
was
a
watercolor
tree
and
the
other
an
abstract
representation
of
inspiration
the
mind
Perhaps
you
check
the
derby
an
average
of
once
every
few
months
and
have
just
gotten
unlucky
but
I
have
been
working
hard
to
have
a
great
deal
of
variety
in
my
designs
recently
both
in
content
and
style
And
don
t
worry
spoiler
alert
this
design
is
not
going

anyway
so
you
can
breathe
a
little
easier
Anyway
thanks
everyone
else
for
the
kind

I
m
glad

help
with
the
halftone

and
might

that

As

this

and
there
are
two
designs
that

this
one
that
fogged
before
it
I
appreciate
all
the

on
this
design
but
the
chances
of
it
making
it
higher
than
8th
or
9th
seem
pretty
slim
to
me
I
d
love
to
be
wrong
though

Personally
I
don

have
a
problem
with
patrickspens
printing
a
shirt
almost
every
week
also
as
long
as
it
is
solid
design
funny
clever
and
or
well
executed
sometimes
I
even
happen
to
find
that
some
ramyb
designs
deserved
their
printing
What
makes
me
mad
is
to
see
that
people
keep
voting
blindly
for
ramyb
s
generic
and
overused
designs
preventing
other
designs
often
more
original
or
better
executed
to
print
and
me
to
buy
these
by
the
way

Wouldnt
personally
buy
this
one
but
I
for
one
have
noticed
how
you
have
branched

somewhat

I
for
one
appreciate
that
you
are
making

effort

moving

Pluto

you
step

Thanks
Okay
Jupiter
you

You
re

And
Saturn
please
show
some
modesty
and
pull
up
your

a

bit
okay
I

we

Turn

50

The

Losing

that

have
no

to
call

gaunt

It
s
a
smart

terminal

20
news
story

The
31
year
old
M
C
debuted
his
new
look
yesterday
on
the
streets
of
New
York
City
causing
widespread
speculation
from
all
media
outlets
that
his
weight
loss
signified
impending
death
Journalists
must
have
been
champing
at
the
bit
in
hopes
that
one
of
the
photos
would
reveal
a
heroin
factory
in
his
pocket
Or
at
the
very
least
a
black

juice
cleanse
His
rep
tells
ET
that
Macaulay
Culkin
is
in
perfectly
good
health
which
naturally
only
leads
to
more
speculation
Where
there
s
a
rep
statement
there
s
likely
a
widespread
cover
up
Or
he
just
lost
weight
But
this
is
a

who
grew
up
in
Hollywood
with
the
Dina

fathers
His
childhood
memories
were
made

True

There
s
no
way
he
just

But
I
guess
we

have
to
wait
for
his
tell

with
Diane
Sawyer
to
find
out
the
truth
What
do
YOU

Is
the

overreacting

How
to
configure
the
Apache
web
server
to
run
SSL
Jan
22
Linux
Windows
Following
is
a
step
by
step
guide
to
creating
a
self
signed
SSL
certificate
for
apache2
on
the
Ubuntu
Linux
distribution
Procedures
here
are
sufficiently
different
from
my
selfsign
html
guide
applying
to
other
linux
distributions
that
it
warranted
a
separate
document
Note
that
this
document
can
be
used
a
couple
different
ways
If
you
follow
all
the
steps
you
ll
have
a
self
signed
SSL
certificate
and
hopefully
a
working
SSL
site
If
you
d
rather
generate
a
Certificate
Authority
CA
which
you
can
use
to
sign
multiple
certificates
then
you
should
read
this
document
my
general
purpose
selfsign
html
document
and
start
with
the
section
at
the
end
of
this
document
Generating
a
CA
under
Ubuntu
1
Preliminaries
and
Packages
If
you
have
a
registered
DNS
name
be
sure
that
you
properly
set
it
up
On
the
Gnome
console
System
Administration
Networking
General
Your
host
domain
name
here
should
match
the
one
you
ll
be
using
in
later
steps
Use
apt
get
apt
get
install
apache2
Synaptic
or
some
other
tool
to
get
and
install
apache2
You
should
also
have
openssl
most
likely
already
installed
su
to
the
superuser
and
make
a
backup
of
the
original
apache
configuration
file
Call
it
whatever
you
want
My
practice
is
to
add
original
to
any
default
configuration
file
before
I
make
changes
and
a
YYYY
MMDD
timestamp
to
later
versions
I
modify
whatever
works
for
you
If
this
is
the
first
time
you
ve
ever
done
this
you
may
want
to
take
backups
at
incremental
change
points
You
should
not
make
a
backup
of
the
file
in
the
sites
enabled
directory
since
both
the
original
and
backup
will
be
loaded
when
you
restart
apache
I
discovered
this
behavior
Also
note
that
a
symlink
exists
from
etc
apache2
sites
enabled
000
default
to
etc
apache2
sites
available
default
Instead
back
it
up
in
the
sites
available
directory
or
some
other
location
sudo
su
cd
etc
apache2
sites
available
cp
etc
apache2
sites
available
default
default
original
2
Run
the
SSL
certificate
generating
script
The
usr
sbin
apache2
ssl
certificate
script
lacks
the
days
xxx
flag
and
creates
a
certificate
that
only
lasts
a
month
by
default
One
visitor
to
this
web
page
suggested
that
the
script
accepts
standard
arguments
so
you
can
pass
additional
flags
to
it
I
ve
not
verified
this
to
be
true
yet
but
I
m
almost
certain
he
is
correct
For
example
to
generate
a
self
signed
certificate
that
lasts
one
year
usr
sbin
apache2
ssl
certificate
days
365
An
alternative
is
to
modify
the
usr
sbin
apache2
ssl
certificate
script
itself
If
you
open
this
script
with
an
editor
you
can
see
that
it
s
just
a
thin
shell
over
native
openssl
commands
Make
a
back
up
this
script
You
ll
see
a
portion
in
it
that
looks
like
this
export
RANDFILE
dev
random
openssl
req
config
usr
share
apache2
ssleay
cnf
new
x509
nodes
out
etc
apache2
ssl
apache
pem
keyout
etc
apache2
ssl
apache
pem
Change
it
to
this
if
want
your
self
signed
cert
to
last
a
full
year
export
RANDFILE
dev
random
openssl
req
config
usr
share
apache2
ssleay
cnf
new
x509
days
365
nodes
out
etc
apache2
ssl
apache
pem
keyout
etc
apache2
ssl
apache
pem
Then
run
the
tweaked
version
answering
the
questions
as
they
come
When
you
re
more
comfortable
working
with
openssl
you
can
check
out
my
other
doc
Creating
a
self
signed
SSL
certificate
run
the
commands
natively
or
modify
this
script
further
to
suit
your
tastes
apache2
ssl
certificate
3
Enable
ssl
a2enmod
ssl
4
Establish
a
necessary
symlink
The
first
command
copies
the
default
configuration
file
for
port
80
to
use
it
as
a
stub
configuration
file
for
443
The
second
command
establishes
a
symlink
from
the
available
ssl
file
to
the
enabled
file
The
symlinking
methodology
between
the
two
directories
as
well
as
mods
available
and
mods
enabled
is
an
arrangement
briefly
explained
in
etc
apache2
README
The
general
idea
is
that
enabled
files
exist
as
symlinks
created
to
their
available
counterparts
cp
etc
apache2
sites
available
default
etc
apache2
sites
available
ssl
ln
s
etc
apache2
sites
available
ssl
etc
apache2
sites
enabled
ssl
5
Set
up
the
document
roots
The
default
location
for
HMTL
pages
with
an
initial
install
of
Ubuntu
is
var
www
and
there
exists
no
separate
place
for
ssl
files
I
prefer
to
serve
up
basic
HTML
pages
in
var
www
html
and
SSL
pages
in
var
www
ssl
html
Whatever
works
for
you
But
at
this
point
I
create
the
directories
cd
var
www
mkdir
html
cd
var
mkdir
www
ssl
cd
www
ssl
mkdir
html
6
Configure
virtual
hosts
Here
you
need
to
tell
the
apache
configuration
file
the
IP
of
your
box
DNS
name
if
any
and
document
roots
you
just
created
in
the
previous
step
To
configure
HTTP
over
port
80
edit
etc
apache2
sites
available
default
NameVirtualHost
80
Note
Look
down
just
a
bit
and
make
a
change
to
the
virtual
host
settings
VirtualHost
80
ServerName
localhost
DocumentRoot
var
www
html
Note
Use
your
assigned
IP
or
DNS
name
followed
with
80
if
you
have
one
for
ServerName
Similar
procedure
for
HTTPS
over
port
443
edit
etc
apache2
sites
available
ssl
NameVirtualHost
443
Note
Look
down
just
a
bit
and
make
a
change
to
the
virtual
host
settings
VirtualHost
443
ServerName
localhost
DocumentRoot
var
www
ssl
html
Note
Again
use
your
assigned
IP
or
a
DNS
name
followed
with
443
if
you
have
one
for
ServerName
7
Instruct
apache2
to
listen
to
443
Go
to
this
file
etc
apache2
ports
conf
and
add
the
following
to
it
Listen
443
8
Turn
on
the
SSL
engine
In
the
middle
of
etc
apache2
sites
available
ssl
file
after
the
commented
area
which
says
Possible
values
include
debug
info
notice
warn
error
crit
add
the
following
SSLEngine
On
SSLCertificateFile
etc
apache2
ssl
apache
pem
9
Make
an
etc
hosts
tweak
if
need
be
and
restart
apache
When
starting
and
stopping
Apache
there
may
be
a
complaint
such
as
Could
not
determine
the
server
s

qualified

for

You
may
encounter
this
if
you
don
t
have
a
DNS
name
for
your
server
and
are
just
using
a
dynamic
IP
If
this
applies
to
you
go
into
your
etc
hosts
file
and
make
the
following
changes
Basically
we
ll
be
adding
localhost
localdomain
to
the
127

and
whatever
system
name
you
chose
when
you
installed
Ubuntu
assuming
you
ve
not

it
The
final
line
below
should
be
there
if
you
have
a
static
IP
and
corresponding
DNS
name
registered
to
it
If
this
is
the
case
earlier
steps
that
wanted

should
have

Generating
a

under
Ubuntu
Skip
this
section
unless
you
want
to
roll
your
own
Ubuntu
Certificate
Authority
CA
using
the
openssl
commands
natively
If
this
is
the
route
you
want
to
take
then
you
should
get
familiar
with
this
document
and
my
selfsign
html
document
The
gameplan
in
a
nutshell
Follow
steps
1
4
on
selfsign
html
then
copy
the
resulting
server
key
and
server
crt
files
into
etc
apache2
ssl
There
may
be
an
apache
pem
file
sitting
there
if
at
some
point
in
the
past
you
used
the
apache2
ssl
certificate
script
supplied
with
Ubuntu
to
generate
a
certificate
rather
than
openssl
natively
You
ll
note
that
this
file
may
have
a
symlink
aimed
at
it
Apache
won
t
need
the
apache
pem
file
or
symlink
any
longer
if
they
exist
You
ll
then
do
all
of
the
steps
in
this
document
with
the
following
exceptions
you
ll
skip
2
you
don
t
need
to
use

in
step

you

not

Edit
your

file
and
remove

Instead
add
this

etc
apache2

You
ll
also
need

script
if

already
done
so
Go
you
usr

If

look
at

it

What
is
the
Domain
Name
System
DNS
The
DNS
is
the
glue
that
keeps
the
Internet
together
DNS
translates
domain
name
example
com
to
an
IP
address
and
vice
versa
It
s
much
easier
for
us
to
remember
names
than
numbers
DNS
is
defined
in
Request
for
Comments
RFCs
1034
and
1035
Basically
any
major
Linux
distro
can
be
used
as
a
DNS
Web
E
mail
and
FTP
server
and
Suse
is
not
an
exception
All
in
one
box
and
one
static
IP
address
That
s
all
you
need
Of
course
I
am
talking
about
an
experimental
machine
An
educative
aproach
If
you
are
seriuos
about
the
Internet
you
are
going
to
need
minimun
two
DNS
servers
an
email
server
a
web
server
an
FTP
server
a
firewall
machine
may
be
using
ipcop
org
a
proxy
server
etc
The
DNS
server
is
very
easy
to
install
All
you
need
to
install
is
the
BIND
package
modified
the
etc
named
conf
file
and
create
your
own
zones
files
If
you
are
using
any
type
of
firewall
keep
port
53
open
for
UDP
and
TCP
This
is
the
port
dedicated
to
DNS
Edit
etc
named
conf
and
add
your
reference
zone
files
Right
after
the
first
reference
zone
file
in
this
case
zone
0
0
127
in
addr
arpa
add
yours
in
my
case
I
added
two
zone
references
enicaragua
net
and
sixbone
com
Pay
close
attention
to
the
open
and
close
braces
quotes
and
semicolons
zone

Zones

Suse
puts
the
named
dir
in
var
lib
named
Here
is
where
your
zones
file
will
be
located
This
is
the
sixbone
com
domain
s
zone
file
unix

var

Now
we
need
to
test
the
zone
files
so
we
type
rndc
reload
next
we
run
rcnamed
start
You
should
get
not
erros
Next
type
rcnamed
status
you
should
see
the
number
of
zones
running
and
the
last
line
will
say
the
server
is
up
and
running
If
you
get
an
error
check
braces
quotes
and
semicolos
in
etc
named
conf
If
you
want
to
know
more
about
CNAME
A
NS
etc
Read
The
DNS
Bind
Book
Have
you
seen
those
sites
that
if
you
don
t
put
the
www
you
cannot
get
to
it
Well
it
s
all
in
the
zone
files
If
you
check
the
sixbone
com
file
you
see
one
reference
with
the
www
and
one
reference
without
it
these
are
called
CNAME
or
alias
Bingo
By
the
same
token
you
create
the
same
way
an
FTP
server
so
on
and
so
forth
In
the
case
of
a
Web
server
you
need
to
check
your
Apache
conf
files
and
make
sure
that
you
create
your
virtual
hosts
reference
as
well
This
is
another
topic
Finally
I
run
the
last
check
using
dig
your
DNS
friend
and
this
is
what
I
get

DNS
is
an
exciting
topic
and
these
few
lines
don
t
even
put
a
dent
to
it
For
example
you
need
to
register
your
own
domain
name
with
a
domain
name
service
provider
i
e
ns
com
buydomains
com
etc
By
creating
these
zone
files
in
your
server
your
DNS
server
is
not
going
to
work
I
mean
it
won
t
resolve
any
domain
name
at
all
may
be
locally
How
the
DNS
work
Here
is
a
link
that
explain
very
well
how
it
works
How
DNS
worksEach
domain
name
must
have
two
DNS
servers
Some
people
named
their
ns1

com

I
named

unix
sixbone

unix

host
name
in
the
UNIX
jargon
The

is
the
root
level
These
are
a
series
of
machines
13
total
to
be
exact
distributed
around
the
world
I
think
Japan
has
two
Europe
has
a
couple
more
the
US
has
the
most
etc
What
are
the
names
of
these
machines
In
your

there
is
a
file
called

Mod
your
Php
installation
to
handle
larger
uploads
Jan
22
Linux
Windows
Though
PHP
presents
a
very
versatile
and
user
friendly
interface
for
handling
file
uploads
the
default
installation
is
not
geared
for
working
with
files
in
excess
of
2
Mega
Bytes
This
article
will
help
you
configure
your
PHP
engine
for
handling
such
large
file
transfers
The
php
ini
File
All
the
configuration
settings
for
your
installation
are
contained
in
the
php
ini
file
Sometimes
these
setting
might
be
overridden
by
directives
in
apache
htaccess
files
or
even
with
in
the
scripts
themselves
However
you
cannot
over
ride
the
settings
that
effect
file
uploads
with
htaccess
directives
in
this
way
So
let
s
just
concentrate
on
the
ini
file
You
can
call
the
phpinfo
function
to
find
the
location
of
your
php
ini
file
it
will
also
tell
you
the
current
values
for
the
following
settings
that
we
need
to
modify
file
uploads
upload
max
filesize
max
input
time
memory
limit
max
execution
time
post
max
size
The
first
one
is
fairly
obvious
if
you
set
this
off
uploading
is
disabled
for
your
installation
We
will
cover
the
rest
of
the
configuration
settings
in
detail
below
upload
max
filesize
and
post
max
size
memory
limit
max
execution
time
and
max
input
time
Files
are
usually
POSTed
to
the
webserver
in
a
format
known
as
multipart
form
data
The
post
max
size
sets
the
upper
limit
on
the
amount
of
data
that
a
script
can
accept
in
this
manner
Ideally
this
value
should
be
larger
than
the
value
that
you
set
for
upload
max
filesize
It
s
important
to
realize
that
upload
max
filesize
is
the
sum
of
the
sizes
of
all
the
files
that
you
are
uploading
post
max
size
is
the
upload
max
filesize
plus
the
sum
of
the
lengths
of
all
the
other
fields
in
the
form
plus
any
mime
headers
that
the
encoder
might
include
Since
these
fields
are
typically
small
you
can
often
approximate
the
upload
max
size
to
the
post
max
size
According
to
the
PHP
documentation
you
can
set
a
MAX
UPLOAD
LIMIT
in
your
HTML
form
to
suggest
a
limit
to
the
browser
Our
understanding
is
that
browsers
totally
ignore
this
directive
and
the
only
solution
that
can
impose
such
a
client
side
restriction
is
our
own
Rad
Upload
Applet
When
the
PHP
engine
is
handling
an
incoming
POST
it
needs
to
keep
some
of
the
incoming
data
in
memory
This
directive
has
any
effect
only
if
you
have
used
the
enable
memory
limit
option
at
configuration
time
Setting
too
high
a
value
can
be
very
dangerous
because
if
several
uploads
are
being
handled
concurrently
all
available
memory
will
be
used
up
and
other
unrelated
scripts
that
consume
a
lot
of
memory
might
effect
the
whole
server
as
well
These
settings
define
the
maximum
life
time
of
the
script
and
the
time
that
the
script
should
spend
in
accepting
input
If
several
mega
bytes
of
data
are
being
transfered
max
input
time
should
be
reasonably
high
You
can
override
the
setting
in
the
ini
file
for
max
input
time
by
calling
the
set
time
limit
function
in
your
scripts
Additonal
Comments
Apache
Settings
Other
Options
The
apache
webserver
has
a
LimitRequestBody
configuration
directive
that
restricts
the
size
of
all
POST
data
regardless
of
the
web
scripting
language
in
use
Some
RPM
installations
sets
limit
request
body
to
512Kb
You
will
need
to
change
this
to
a
larger
value
or
remove
the
entry
altogether
If
you
expect
to
handle
a
large
number
of
concurrent
file
transfers
on
your
website
consider
using
a
perl
or
java
server
side
component
PHP
happens
to
be
our
favourite
web
programming
language
as
well
but
perl
and
Java
are
just
slightly
ahead
when
it
comes
to
file
upload
Most
installations
of
perl
as
an
apache
module
can
accept
in
excess
of
32
megabytes
out
of
the
box
Compare
this
against
the
2MB
default
for
PHP
The
downside
is
that
perl
coding
takes
just
a
bit
more
effort
than
PHP
but
it
s
worth
it
You
can
try
our
sample
scripts
to
get
started
none

UPDATE
February
8th
This
morning
St
Petersburg
legislators
passed
the
2nd
reading
of
the
outrageous
propaganda
bill
that
will
silence
millions
of
Russian
LGBT
voices
Our
friend
Polina
reports
that
we
still
have
time
to
call
our
world
leaders
the
final
vote
will
come
next
week
Call
your
foreign
affairs
office
now
and
spread
the
word
HERE
The
Russian
law
to
silence
LGBT
people
is
back
and
we
need
to
act
now
Lawmakers
are
about
to
vote
on
bill
that
will
make
it
illegal
for
any
person
to
write
a
book
publish
an
article
or
speak
in
public
about
being
gay
lesbian
bi
or
transgender
And
this
is
just
the
beginning
if
the
law
passes
in
St
Petersburg
officials
have
threatened
to
take
it
nationwide
Activists
in
St
Petersburg
are
rushing
to
organize
a
public
protest
against
the
bill
but
no
matter
where
you
are
you
can
stand
with
them
Join
this
call
to
leaders
around
the
world
to
reach
out
to
their
counterparts
in
the
Russian
government
and
ask
them
to
reject
this
discriminatory
and
anti
democratic
law
To
WORLD
LEADERS
The
party
led
by
Russian
President
Medvedev
and
Prime
Minister
Putin
is
pushing
discriminatory
legislation
against
lesbian
bi
gay
and
trans
people
that
could
eliminate
their
freedom
to
speak
publicly
and
assemble
Russia
is
a
signatory
to
numerous
international
human
rights
treaties
including
the
European
Convention
on
Human
Rights
We
call
on
you
to
urgently
speak
out
and
hold
Russia
accountable
to
its
treaty
obligations
and
stand
with
LGBT
Russians
whose
ability
to
speak
for
themselves
is
under
attack

Go

Accentuate

Too
late
we
all
heard
you
Hmm
you
re
wanting
to
take
your

back
Well
that
s
a
bit
tricky
See
we
do
a
lot
of
stuff
with
your
vote
using
it
to
work
out
the
popularity
of
what
you
voted
for
compare
that
to
all
the
other
things
voted
on
tally
up
our
leaderboard
work
out
your
reputation
Someday
we
ll
do
a
little
cartoon
showing
just
how
hard
your
vote
is
working
Anyway
taking
votes
back
messes
all
that
up
so
we
give
you
five
minutes
in
case
you
just
mis
clicked
After
that
we
ve
got
to
say
no
take
backs
Luckily
votes
are
free
so
feel
free
to
throw
them
around
left

you

Shiver

Ye
see
this
beautiful
chess
set
Tis
something
else
Beautifully
designed
it
features
pirate
themed
pieces
Instead
of
the
typical
black
and
white
sets
these
pirates
and
canons
come
in
vibrant
blue
and
red
sets
so
you
can

pieces
to

The
board
is
surrounded
on
all
four
corners
with
pirates
There
are
two
drawers
for
each
player
to
stow
away
his
or
her
crew
Lightweight
and
elegant
this
set
is
both
decorative
and
practical
for
usage

price

Your

I
can

even
run
your

February
10
2012

today
announced
his
Alaska
Steering
Committee
Alaska
voters
have
felt
the
effects
of

Obama
s
policies
in
Washington
said
Mitt

This
president
s
overreaching
regulations

policy

hampered

An
Open
Letter
from
Conservative
Leader
James
Bopp
Jr
Guest
Author
February
7
2012
My
Fellow
Conservatives
Like
all
conservative
Republicans
and
most
Americans
I
believe
that
the
future
of
our
country
and
the
preservation
of
our
way
of
life
depends
on
the
defeat
of
President
Barack
Obama
and
his
replacement
with
a
president
who
supports
free
enterprise
limited
government
traditional
family
values
and
a
strong
national
defense
based
upon
the
principles
of
our
United
States
Constitution
Because
of
my
obligations
with
the
Republican
National
Committee
and
my
belief
that
any
of
the
major
Republican
presidential
candidates
would
advance
our
conservative
principles
I
have
stayed
neutral
hoping
that
one
candidate
would
emerge
with
the
demonstrated
ability
and
support
to
take
on
and
defeat
President
Obama
That
candidate
has
now
emerged
and
as
a
result
it
is
time
to
put
aside
our
minor
intra
family
differences
to
end
the
increasingly
divisive
primary
fight
and
to
unite
to
focus
on
achieving
our
shared
goal
of
defeating
President
Obama
That
candidate
is
Governor
Mitt
Romney
Mitt
Romney
is
a
true
conservative
One
does
not
have
to
guess
what
Mitt
Romney
would
do
in
office
He
served
for
four
years
as
Governor
of
Massachusetts
and
has
a
record
that
conservatives
should
be
proud
of
As
Governor
Romney
fought
for
social
conservative
values
He
vetoed
bills
that
would
have
authorized
state
funding
of
embryonic
cloning
would
have
changed
the
definition
of
human
life
from
fertilization
to
implantation
and
would
have
given
young
women
the
morning
after
abortion
pill
without
a
prescription
He
promoted
abstinence
education
in
public
schools
When
the
Massachusetts
Supreme
Court
legalized
same
sex
marriage
he
left
no
stone
unturned
to
set
aside
that
ruling
And
in
contrast
to
the
Obama
Administration
s
war
on
the
Catholic
Church
by
mandating
their
institutions
to
provide
contraceptives
and
abortion
inducing
drugs
in
their
health
care
plans
Governor
Romney
vetoed
a
bill
that
would
have
required
Catholic
hospitals
to
offer
abortion
inducing
drugs
to
potential
rape
victims
Of
course
it
is
true
that
Romney
had
a
conversion
to
the
pro
life
cause
not
unlike
other
Republicans
such
as
Ronald
Reagan
and
George
H
W
Bush
We
should
not
only
embrace
him
as
a
result
of
this
conversion
but
also
recognize
that
he
is
a
success
story
But
the
best
test
of
the
sincerity
of
a
conversion
is
deeds
and
Mitt
Romney
was
consistently
pro
life
as
Governor
according
to
the
President
of
Massachusetts
Citizens
for
Life
On
the
issues
currently
deemed
the
most
important
by
the
American
people
the
economy
and
federal
taxes
and
spending
Romney
also
has
a
remarkable
record
As
a
private
investor
in
struggling
businesses
Romney
was
very
successful
in
turning
them
around
As
governor
he
issued
more
than
800
vetoes
and
cut
taxes
19
times
The
result
in
a
state
with
an
overwhelmingly
Democratic
legislature
is
that
he
closed
a
3
billion
dollar
budget
gap
and
turned
it
into
a
2
billion
dollar
rainy
day
fund
Mitt
Romney
s
success
in
the
first
five
primary
states
including
wins
in
New
Hampshire
Florida
and
Nevada
have
revealed
an
emerging
consensus
among
Republican
voters
that
he
is
the
most
electable
the
most
likely
Republican
candidate
to
defeat
Obama
Romney
has
the
broadest
support
among
all
elements
of
the
Republican
party
electorate
has
the
most
appeal
to
independents
and
swing
voters
and
is
therefore
the
most
electable
of
all
It
is
time
therefore
to
celebrate
the
result
and
concentrate
all
our
energy
on
achieving
a
general
election
victory

it

Shane
Brennan
tells

And
while
the
backstory
will
unspool
over
back
to

episodes
It
takes
place
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
as
Kensi
is
pushed
to
the
limit
while
Deeks
is
running
behind
trying
to
stop
her
from
destroying
the
things
that
she

about
Brennan

that
the
catalyst
for
this

was
embedded

Zach
writes
Person
of
Interest
has
really
been
on
a
roll
as
of
late
Do
you
have
any
info
or
scoopage
about
upcoming
episodes
As
a
matter
of
fact
I
can
tell
you
that
the
very
next
episode
airing
Feb
16
will
put
one
of
the
team
members
in
jeopardy
As
a
direct
result
of
helping
Reese
and
Finch
with
their
latest
mission
Fusco
played
by
Kevin
Chapman
will
end
up
on
the
wrong
end
of
a
gun
ready
to
meet
his
Maker
House
One
ray
of
light
for
those
sad
to
see
Fox
s
House
end
in
May
is
that
we
ll
finally
get
a
Chase
centric
episode
la
past
hours
that
have
focused
on
Cuddy
or
Wilson
And
that
pleases
Jesse
Spencer
I
ve
been
extremely
enamored
with
how
smart
incredible
and
worthwhile
this
show
is
it
s
crossed
a
lot
of
different
boundaries
notes
the
actor
And
to
finally
have
an
episode
which
literally
follows
me
around
is
absolutely
terrifying
but
I
was
extremely
grateful
to
have
the
opportunity
to
spread
my
wings
Specifically
Chase
while
recuperating
from
last
week
s
near
paralysis
will
treat
a
nun
and
not
just
any
old
nun
but
a
cloistered
nun
Spencer
reports
That
means
she
has
like
no
human
contact
does
silent
prayer
12
hours
a
day
And
while
promos
suggest
the
two
get
surprisingly
close
in
an
ahem
almost
Biblical
sense
they
will
also
bond
in
another
Chase
went
to
a
seminary
when
he
was
younger
so
a
lot
of
that
stuff
is
brought
up
The
Walking
Dead
While
speaking
with
executive
producer
Gale
Anne
Hurd
about
the
midseason
premiere
airing
this
Sunday
I
was
sure
to
dig
up
that
old
chestnut
about
the
freshman
season
ending
whisper
between
Jenner
the
CDC
scientist
and
Rick
Of
course
many
had
speculated
at
the
time
that
Rick
had
learned
that
wife
Lori
was
pregnant
but
Hurd
now
is
willing
to
rule
out
that
one
theory
seeing
as
Rick
wouldn
t
have
been
surprised
to
get
the
official
word
a
few
episodes
back
As
for
when
we
ll
learn
what
was
disclosed
by
Jenner
Hurd
promises
viewers
I
don
t
think
your
wait
is
too
long

Did
anyone
else
get
an
unsettling
vibe
this
week
when
Kramer

Bridges

with

his
concerns
about
the
NYC
FBI
office
possibly
being
complicit
with
Neal
s
sketchy
endeavors
Is
he
merely
looking
to
do
right
or
is
he
perhaps
also
operating
off
an
agenda
Both
answers
Tim
DeKay
But
it
s
extremely
well
written
in
that
his
agenda
is
not
Machiavellian
He
s
not
being
evil
with
it
and
you
ll
understand
where
he
s
coming
from
Nonetheless
Peter
would
be
wise
to
be
very
judicious
in
deciding
whether
to
commute
Caffrey
s
sentence
As
seen
in
the
next
episode
which
DeKay
directed
Peter
will
realize
his
decision
is
going
to
not
just
decide
Neal
s
fate
but
possibly
also
decide
his
own
Sitcom
Scoops
Ever
wonder
where
The
Big
Bang
Theory
s
Sheldon
gets
his
very
special
hairstyle
You
soon
will
find
out
when
we
meet
his
the
guy
who
cuts
his
hair
or
much
to
Sheldon
s
great
horror
the
guy
s
nephew
who
s
filling
in
for
his
regular
barber
It
looks
like
the
2
Broke
Girls
savings
is
due
for
a
setback
when
it
falls
upon
Caroline
to
pony
up
the
money
needed
to
keep
her
incarcerated
father
s
lawyer
around
long
enough
for
her
to
give
her
deposition
As
we
first
told
you
Megan
Mullally
has
joined
Fox
s
Breaking
In
for
Season
2
as
Oz
s
boss
though
the
team
will
get
a
bit
of
a
bait
and
switch
when
she
first
shows
up
Alphonso
McAuley
who
plays
Cash
tells
me
that
Contra
s
new
owner
will
first
pass
herself
off
as
just
a
receptionist
as
she
gathers
intel
on
her
underlings

there

I
don
t
see
the
POI
twist
ending
well
for
Fuscoe
or
Chapman
since
now
that
Taraji
Henson
is
part
of
the
gang
he
s
officially
a
redundant
character
So
funny
I
watched
the
first
episodes
and
always
said
when
he
came
on
look
there
s
the
character
that
gets
written
off
before
the
end
of
the
first
season

I
hope
this
isn
t
true
I
love
Fusco
s
sleazy
edge
He
ll
go
places
and
do
things
like
the
surveillance
on
Finch
and
planting
evidence
that
Carter
wouldn

I
agree
Reece
intimidates
deals
with
Fusco
in
a
way
he
would
not
even
consider
with
Carter
Him
saying
they
were
friends
last
night
cracked
me
up
He
had
a
hard
time
getting
the
words
out

I
don
t
have
a
clue
who
that
is
I
ve
seen
every
episode
but
don
t
recall
that
name
Also
what
else
is
new
about
White
Collar
being
extremely
well
written
outside
of
stretching
that
commutation
bit
too
thin
over
too
long

Fusco
is
the
NYPD
detective
that
was
dirty
in
the
beginning
but
now
works
for
the
team
originally
under
threat
of
blackmail
Reese
sarcastically
calls
him
by
his
first
name

I
ll
be
absolutely
watching
the
Chase
episode
on
House
Jesse
Spencer
s
performance
in
Nobody
s
Fault
last
week
was
awesome
and
I
bet
he
does
a
great
job
with
Chase
Hope
he
lands
some
cool
movies
or
tv
roles
after
House
Plus
he
s
incredibly
handsome

Too
bad
for
Fusco
got
to
liking
him
but
with
him
getting
so
little
airtime
and
Carter
now
assisting
Reese
and
Finch
I
can
see
his
character
leaving
in
one
form
or
another
it
can
also
be
a
red
herring
and
he
stays
At
least
Reese
gave
him
a
chance
instead
of
knocking
him
off
in
the
beginning

I

pretty
sure
it
s
already
been
mentioned
by
Sheldon
in
one
episode
that
Sheldon
get

his
hair
cut
at
SuperCuts
Of

he
could
have
changed
his

As
much
as
I
love
TBBT
I
hate
the
continuity
errors
Sheldon
used
to
love
the
hospital
He
wanted
to
have
his
brain
waves
measured
He
LOVED
Leonard
s
doctor
girlfriend
because
she
was
their
McCoy
Then
he
was
freaked
out
by
germs
in
the
hospital
Now
he
passes
out
at
the
sight
of
his
own
blood
I
don
t
think
so
Supercuts
to
NOT
would
be
just
one
more
of
these
continuity
holes
Do
the
writers
honestly
think
we
don
t
remember

by

on

LA
It
sounds

Want
to
know

she

and
what
she
have
done

she
was
in

Can

Jesse
Spencer
is
an
outstanding
actor
and
the
subtlety
of
his
performance
in
Nobody
s
Doubt
blew
me
away
That
was
the
best
episode
of
House
in
years
and
I
m
anxiously
awaiting
next
weeks
Chase
I
m
especially
happy
to
see
that
Chase
s
faith
will
finally
be
addressed
again

That
guy
can
convey
all
sorts
of
emotions
with
his
eyes
without
even
saying
a
word
That
scene
in
Nobody
s
Fault
where
Chase
was
being
interviewed
by
Cofield
was
very
impressive
It
would
be
awesome
if
he
ends
up
with
an
Emmy
Golden
Globe
or
SAG
nomination
for
his
work
this
season
not
holding
my
breath
though
Jesse
s
an
asset
to
the
show
so
sad
that
he
was
squandered
for
a
number
of
seasons
glad
the
producers
finally
got
a
clue
before
it
was
too
late

the

Better

The

promises
savory

and
a

to
start
followed
by
a

accompanied
by

Lynn
Yeldell
and
Alisa
Weldon
will
be
recognized
with
the
Visibility
Award
at
the
2012
Austin
HRC
Gala
This
award
recognizes
LGBT
individuals
who
are
living
open
and
honest
lives
at
home
at
work
and
in
their
greater
community
The
couple
met
at
the
Austin
Gay
and
Lesbian
Film
Festival
Lynn
found
Alisa
s
energy
and
enthusiasm
infectious
and
these
same
qualities
became
the
foundation
to
starting
L
Style
G
Style
The
couple
talked
with
Austinist
about
being
honored
with
the
award
the
difficulties
of
living
openly
and
honestly
and
their
views
on
the
Austin
LGBT
community
What
does
the
Visibility
Award
mean
to
you
How
would
you
describe
living
open
and
honest
lives
Alisa
Having
an
organization
as
impressive
as
HRC
recognize
us
is
a
humbling
honor
I
feel
and
believe
that
living
out
and
open
is
a
social
responsibility
for
us
all
We
won
t
change
negative
opinions
if
we
don
t
create
positive
experiences
for
others
to
witness
Both
Lynn
and
I
are
reminded
daily
that
it
s
ok
to
be
out
every
single
day
For
many
fear
of
ultimate
rejection
from
family
and
co
workers
doesn
t
allow
for
ultimate
personal
freedom
I
know
that
every
time
Lynn
and
I
walk
out
of
our
house
we
re
judged
and
we
want
every
experience
you
have
with
us
both
personally
and
professionally
to
be
one
of
integrity
transparency
and
genuine
openness
We
represent
the
very
essence
of
our
business
and
we
want
nothing
more
than
to
create
conversations
and
feeling
of
ease
for
those
that
engage
us
Has
it
ever
been
difficult
for
you
to
live
openly
and
honestly
Lynn
Throughout
my
career
I
have
worked
in
some
traditionally
very
conservative
industries
such
as
banking
and
wealth
management
Thankfully
the
large
majority
of
my
colleagues
have
been
welcoming
and
supportive
but
there
still
exists
an
undercurrent
of
discrimination
and
lack
of
understanding
I
specifically
remember
a
conversation
with
my
branch
manager
at
UBS
who
requested
that
I
no
longer
display
L
Style
G
Style
in
the
lobby
of
our
office
It
was
a
really
sad
day
to
watch
the
magazine
which
represented
all
that
I
stood
for
in
being
open
and
honest
in
my
life
be
banned
from
the
very
place
that
I
worked
and
spent
the
majority
of
my
waking
hours
Alisa
Yes
I
lived
in
the
closet
with
a
design
and
marketing
client
of
mine
The
Scooter
Store
from
2001
2004
Because
the
company
had
a
strong
family
and
somewhat
religious
culture
when
personal
questions
were
asked
during
meetings
I
would
steer
clear
of
answering
them
with
honesty
In
all
truthfulness
I
was
afraid
of
sharing
my
personal
life
with
them
in
fear
of
losing
them
as
a
client
at
the
time
I
m
happy
to
say
that
when
they
reengaged
me
in
2007
to
do
some
projects
for
them
I
came
out
to
them
and
my
message
was
received
warmly
My
professional
career
began
in
1994
and
with
all
the
businesses
I
ve
worked
or
with
there
were
only
a
few
that
I
stayed
in
the
closet
with
primarily
because
religious
aspects
of
company
culture
were
overly
apparent
and
public
What
do
you
think
of
the
HRC
s
mission
and
how
it
applies
specifically
to
Austin
Lynn
First
Austin
is
so
wonderfully
welcoming
to
most
all
types
of
diversity
So
welcoming
that
when
people
visit
they
are
a
bit
thrown
off
that
we
don
t
have
a
large
and
vibrant
gay
district
I
think
that
it
is
a
testament
to
the
work
that
HRC
is
doing
across
the
nation
working
for
equality
Austin
just
happens
to
be
more
evolved
creatively
and
intellectually
perhaps
though
there
is
still
much
work
to
do
Another
thing
I
think
of
is
that
we
are
also
a
capital
town
But
how
many
friends
do
you
have
that
step
foot
in
those
offices
advocating
for
LGBT
rights
and
advocacy
I
am
so
thankful
to
HRC
for
their
lobbying
and
advocacy
on
a
national
level
while
also
taking
keen
and
active
interests
in
pivotal
local
races
What
has
been
your
experience
with
the
HRC
so
far
Lynn
I
have
been
active
with
HRC
since
my
first
Gala
Dinner
in
New
Orleans
in
1998
and
have
served
in
most
all
of
the
volunteer
roles
from
Board
of
Governor
Dinner
Co
Chair
and
more
As
with
any
non
profit
advocacy
organization
I
have
disagreed
with
a
handful
of
positions
they
have
taken
in
the
nearly
15
years
of
my
involvement
But
on
the
whole
HRC
is
the
one
organization
that
I
have
been
able
to
rely
on
to
help
take
divisive
issues
such
as
Don
t
Ask
Don
t
Tell
and
marriage
equality
and
make
real
change
Sure
I
would
love
to
see
change
come
faster
but
they
are
the
only
organization
that
has
made
any
consistent
change
on
these
issues
What
inspired
you
to
start
L
Style
G
Style
Alisa
I
wanted
to
create
something
that
was
reflective
of
how
I
live
my
life
leading
a
professional
life
giving
back
to
my
community
and
having
my
sexual
orientation
be
the
last
element
of
focus
when
first
impressions
are
made
I
wanted
to
focus
on
the
positive
aspects
of
those
who
have
contributed
to
the
community
and
make
it
better
who
happen
to
be
gay
or
lesbian
The
way
my
father
was
raised
Southern
Baptist
was
the
impetus
of
trying
to
change
opinions
of
who
the
gay
community
is
in
the
eyes
of
the
straight
community
It
was
his
desire
for
me
to
be
the
best
I
could
be
and
my
grandmother
s
lessons
on
connecting
to
the
community
around
you
that
drove
me
to
create
something
any
family
could
read
and
not
feel
awkward
discussing
or
sharing
I
wanted
and
want
L
Style
G
Style
to
be
a
positive
experience
that
would
inspire
young
gay
and
lesbian
people
to
know
that
there
life
can
be
as
important
as
others
How
do
you
think
the
magazine
has
changed
the
Austin
LGBT
community
Alisa
I
feel
strongly
that
we
have
not
only
brought
the
lesbian
and
gay
community
together
which
for
those
that
don
t
know
in
past
history
we
haven
t
played
well
together
but
we
have
created
a
sense
of
inclusivity
for
us
all
making
being
gay
a
non
issue
I
feel
we
ve
put
a
face
to
the
gay
community
and
while
we
don
t
have
a
one
size
fits
all
representation
I
know
for
those
outside
the
circle
of
the
gay
community
have
new
interest
in
who
we
are
what
we
do
and
what
our
story
is
all
about
How
do
you
think
it
s
changed
Austin
in
general
Lynn
Because
we
have
free
distribution
throughout
the
city
we
are
accessible
to
everyone
We
hear
numerous
stories
from
straight
allies
who
read
the
magazine
for
months
without
realizing
that
all
of
the
people
profiled
on
the
cover
all
happened
to
be
gay
That
is
one
of
the
highest
compliments
we
can
receive
as
it
is
our
aim
to
first
tell
the
story
of
the
person
which
ultimately
opens
minds
and
changes
lives
L
Style
G
Style
has
provided
unique
access
and
coverage
of
our
gay
and
lesbian
community
showing
that
the
most
remarkable
part
about
us
is
that
we
really
that
remarkable
How
is
Austin
s
LGBT
community
different
from
other
LGBT
communities
you
may
have
lived
in
or
visited
Alisa
Growing
up
in
Friendswood
TX
a
highly
conservative
Quaker
town
is
no
comparison
I
gravitated
to
Austin
because
I
had
heard
that
it
was
a
welcoming
community
and
it
was
ok
to
be
out
due
to
a
fairly
growing
gay
community
My
reference
is
dated
and
at
the
time
of
moving
here
in
1993
Ellen
DeGeneres
hadn
t
even
come
out
With
that
said
when
we
visit
other
cities
and
talk
about
what
we
do
in
Austin
there
is
overwhelming
response
to
launch
L
Style
G
Style
for
general
awareness
What
do
you
hope
for
the
future
of
the
LGBT
community
in
Austin
Alisa
That
diversity
is
welcomed
throughout
the
community
The
divisiveness
I
see
with
LGBT
community
becomes
more
cohesive
and
collaborative
Because
the
majority
of
highly
supportive
organizations
supported
by
the
LGBT
community
were
founded
at
the
beginning
of
the
AIDS
crisis
I
hope
we
continue
to
educate
enlighten
and
garner
the
support
of
the
greater
community
I
hope
that
businesses
families
and
churches
open
doors
to
LGBT
individuals
with
love
compassion
and
support
so
that
we
all
can
just
get
along
Most
importantly
I
wish
for
the
participation
every
LGBT
person
in
Austin
to
live
out
come
out
support
those
that
support
us
and
vote

AIDS
activist
and
patient
Antonio
Davis
speaks
in
front
of
the
Wilson
Building
yesterday
on
his
case
which
goes
to
trial
in
May
On
the
same
day
in
2011
that
Mayor
Vince
Gray
members
of
the
D
C
Council
and
more
than
30
residents
were
arrested
during
a
protest
on
Capitol
Hill
for
D
C
voting
rights
Antonio
Davis
and
11
other
activists
were
arrested
outside
the
ceremonial
office
of
House
Majority
Leader
Eric
Cantor
as
they
angrily
decried
cuts
to
HIV
AIDS
funding
and
needle
exchange
programs
in
the
District
But
while
Gray
and
the
majority
of
those
he
was
arrested
with
were
allowed
to
pay
a
50
fine
and
go
on
their
merry
way
Davis
who
lives
in
Philadelphia
faces
trial
in
May
and
could
well
spend
six
months
in
jail
if
convicted
of
a
single
misdemeanor
count
of
unlawful
entry
Why
Because
he
failed
a
drug
test
having
tested
positive
for
marijuana
that
his
doctor
has
recommended
he
use
to
treat
the
AIDS
he
suffers
from
After
the
April
11
arrest
Davis
and
the
11
other
activists
were
offered
a
standard
Deferred
Prosecution
Agreement
under
which
they
had
to
stay
away
from
the
Cannon
House
Office
Building
for
six
months
perform
32
hours
of
community
service
and
test
negative
in
three
drug
tests
If
they
did
so
within
four
months
the
charges
against
them
would
be
dropped
By
June
they
had
all
completed
the
community
service
and
10
of
the
12
successfully
came
in
negative
in
their
drug
tests
But
for
Davis
and
fellow
protester
David
Goode
the
medical
marijuana
that
their
doctors
have
recommended
they
use
to
ease
the
pain
and
side
effects
of
their
other
AIDS
medications
registered
in
the
tests
Having
been
assured
by
a
judge
that
marijuana
isn
t
screened
for
and
having
turned
in
letters
from
their
doctors
attesting
to
their
need
for
the
marijuana
both
expected
that
the
U
S
Attorney
for
the

would
honor

Prosecution

to
a
new
prosecutor
and
then
a
third
All
12
activists
were
told
that
their
first
32
hours
of
community
service
didn
t
count
and
were
told
to
complete
32
more
By
January
2012
Davis
and
Goode
tested
positive
for
marijuana
again
foregoing
any
alternative
to
a
trial
altogether
The
nine
others
were
told
that
they
would
have
to
do
a
third
32
hour
stint
of
community
service
or
similarly
go
to
trial
Requiring
repeated
drug
tests
repeated
unpaid
community
services
and
a
half
dozen
court
appearances
is
completely
unreasonable
on
a
charge
for
which
city
council
members
pay
a
fine
and
walk
away
from
said
Matt
Kavanagh
who
is
the
Director
of
Advocacy
at
the
Health
GAP
in
the
District
and
was
arrested
alongside
Davis
But
according
to
William
Miller
a
spokesman
for
the
U
S
Attorney
for
the
District
the
prosecutors
have
followed
standard
procedure
in
Davis
case
Additionally
he
noted
Gray
and
the
D
C
voting
rights
protesters
were
prosecuted
by
the
D
C
Attorney
General
which
would
explain
the
different
approaches
These
cases
were
handled
consistently
with
the
diversion
policies
of
the
U
S
Attorney
s
Office
The
case
involving
Mayor
Gray
and
others
had
a
different
set
of
circumstances
and
was
not
handled
by
the
U
S
Attorney
s
Office
The
District
of
Columbia
Office
of
Attorney
General
handled
that
matter
The
conduct
in
this
particular
case
led
to
a
charge
of
unlawful
conduct
on
Capitol
grounds
a
misdemeanor
that
is
prosecuted
by
the
U
S
Attorney
s
Office
The
U
S
Attorney
s
Office
requires
defendants
to
pass
drug
tests
to
qualify
for
diversion
he
said
That
s
of
little
solace
to
Davis
who
says
that
he
used
marijuana
one
a
week
to
counteract
the
side
effects
of
the
nine
other
medications
he
takes
and
to
stimulate
his
appetite
I
ve
been
prescribed
medical
marijuana
because
it
s
the
only
the
thing
that
helps
me
in
my
condition
I
do
not
use
marijuana
as
a
substance
to
get
high
he
said
The
ongoing
legal
drama
has
taken
its
toll
on
him
he
says
He
s
given
up
using
marijuana
for
the
time
being
and
has
lost
20
pounds
over
the
last
two
months
He
s
had
to
travel
back
and
forth
between
Philadelphia
and
the
District
five
times
for
hearings
and
he
worries
that
a
conviction
would
put
his
career
as
a
paralegal
in
jeopardy
He
also
sees
little
humor
in
the
fact
that
as
of
January
D
C
Pre
Trial
Services
stopped
testing
for
marijuana
since
his
case
predates
the
change
in
policy
He
just
wants
this
to
be
over
I
ask
that
U
S
Attorney
for
the
District
Ron
Machen
look
in
his
heart
to
make
a
reasonable
decision
and
let
those
enter
into
the
Pre
Trial
Services
Diversion
Program
or
drop
the
case
and
dismiss
all
charges
against
all
protesters
he
said

It
s
time
for
your
weekly
warnings
of
Metro
track
work
and
if
you
re
a
Blue
Line
user
consider
yourself
lucky
According
to
WMATA
every
line
but
the
Blue
will
be
undergoing
some
sort
of
work
from
10
p
m
tonight
until
the
system
closes
on
Sunday
On
the
Orange
Line
shuttle
buses
will
replace
train
service
between
East
Falls
Church
and
West
Falls
Church
On
the
Red
Line
expect
single
tracking
between
Van
Ness
and
Friendship
Heights
and
between
New
York
Avenue
and
Rhode
Island
Avenue
On
the
Green
Line
things
will
be
slow
going
between
Naylor
Road
and
Branch
Avenue
and
L
Enfant
Plaza
and
Mt
Vernon
Square
The
Yellow
Line
is
a
little
more
complicated
On
Friday
evening
after
10
p
m
Yellow
Line
trains
will
operate
every
26
minutes
between
Fort
Totten
and
Huntington
Customers
should
allow
15
20
minutes
of
additional
travel
time
On
Saturday
and
Sunday
all
Yellow
Line
trains
will
operate
via
the
Blue
Line
between
Huntington
and
Stadium
Armory
on
a
regular
weekend
schedule
Customers
should
allow
15
minutes
of
additional
travel
time
between
L
Enfant
Plaza
and
Pentagon
stations
At
L
Enfant
Plaza
all
Yellow
Line
trains
will
depart
from
the
Lower
Level
All
of
this
work
is
part
of
Metro
s
5
billion
capital
improvement
program
In
short
it
might
be
annoying
now
but
it
would
be
way
more
annoying
in
the
future
if
this
stuff
didn
t
get
done
now

I

Could

Under

lazydazy
disqus
On
Saturday
and
Sunday
the
Yellow
Line
trains
will
run
as
usual
between
Huntington
and
the
Pentagon
but
instead
of
traveling
over
the
Potomac
River
they
will
travel
onward
from
the
Pentagon
using
the
Blue
Line
tracks
through
Arlington
Cemetery
Roslyn
GW
etc
and
continue
on
that
line
until
they
get
to
Stadium
Armory
from
which
they
will
make
the
return
trip
If
you
typically
take
the
Yellow
Line
farther
north
from
L
Enfant
Plaza
you
will
need
to
go
upstairs
at
L
Enfant
Plaza
and
take
the
Green
Line
toward
Greenbelt
The
reason
they
said
add
15
minutes
between
the
Pentagon
and
L
Enfant
Plaza
is
because
you
will
be
taking
the
long
way
around

Going
to
bars
alone
is
really
kind
of
my
forte
I
do
have
friends
and
a
wife
really
While
there
are
a
couple
terrific
places
on
the
TBD
list
there
s
also
too
many
cramped
spaces
and
sh
tholes
with
bad
beer
cough
coughUgly
Mugcough
cough
They
also
can
t
be
too
hot
or
happening
cause
you
won
t
really
fit
in
and
service
can
t
be
flighty
My
personal
faves
good
beer
selections
a
given
Paradiso
Dupont
while
violating
the
tight
spaces
that
s
what
she
said
rule
it
s
surprisingly
easy
to
snag
a
stool
with
so
many
people
heading
to
tables
Iron
Horse
Tavern
excellent
happy
hour
deals
plenty
of
bar
and
small
table
space
to
chill
out
Churchkey
go
early
for
a
comfy
bar
chair
Perfect
bartenders
for
chatting
about
the
beer
or
not
bothering
you
much
at
all
Molly

some

lots

Fado
yeah
it
s
a
chain
but
they
have
good
Guinness
and
proper
football
BombaySplashVermouth
Best
bars
for
really
getting
along
alone
have
a
sign
that
barely
lights
and
the
only
thing
showing
is
Ba
r
The
bar
edge
has
worn
in
elbow
slots
The
duct
tape
seats
are
not
only
grey
but
OD
green
which
shows
some
old
Sargent
from
the
military
stopped
by
and
used
some
tape
from
his
vehicle
A
place
where
there
are
no
last
names
and
very
few
real
first
names
Or
a
nice
lesbian
bar
knackers
I
ll
second
the
vote
on
Churchkey
busy
or
empty
if
you
get
a
spot
at
the
bar
they
look
after
you
good
I
have
to
give
a
big
vote
for
the
Argonaut
though
always
good
beers
food
is
decent
always
a
seat
at
the
bar
and
the
beer
garden
is
great
on
a
summer
night
Plus
I
can
walk
home
Modestproposal1
Thirded
and
it
also
extends
to
NRG
s
other
bars
and
restaurants
one
of
which
EatBar
is
on
that
list
Rustico
in
Arlington
is
my
neighborhood
bar
and
the
bartenders
always
treat
me
well
It
s
one
of
the
few
places
on
earth
that
I
don
t
feel
incredibly
awkward
or
out
of
place
when
I
m
there
by
myself
Thankfully
that
doesn
t
happen
too
often
but
it
s
nice
to
have
that
option
if
I
just
need
to
get
out
of
the
apartment
for
a
bit
dcissound
Yes
on
Churchkey
and
also
I
am
super
in
favor
of
Galaxy
Hut
because
it
is
right
down
the
street
from
the
office
Another
Arlington
place
that
is
no
longer
around
is
Kitty
O
Sheas
Damn
I
miss
that
place
DCwise
if
you
don
t
need
ambience
but
want
decent
beer
and
some
space
Lou
s
City
Bar
in
Columbia
Heights
is
great
especially
the
half
price
drafts
all
day
special
I
ve
drank
alone
at
Lucky
Bar
too
while
watching
big
soccer
matches
you
always
make
a
friend
or
5
during
those
times
Oh
the
back
bar
at
930
or
the
red
room
at
BC
are
also
great
before
after
a
show
although
Red
Room
gets
really
crowded
later
in
the
night
Lots
of
fun
on
off
nights
though
knackers
Big
fan
of
the
Red
Room
although
I
disgraced
myself
there
one
night
by
leaving
a
full
pint
behind
I
was
too
drunk
to
touch
it
Not
ready
to
return
yet

Overlooked

over

I
really
like
The

Very
nice

a

Their
beer
which
should
be
a

is
a
bit
of
a
weakness
Tough
to

I

a

etc
some

then
some

Though
it
has
always
been
accepted
as
common
law
yesterday
the
Virginia
House
of
Delegates
passed
a
measure
that
officially
grants
civil
immunity
to
those
who
use
deadly
force
against
intruders
reports
the
Washington
Times
Known
as
the
Castle
doctrine
the
measure
merely
codifies
a
person
s
right
to
shoot
someone
who
breaks
into
their
house
and
not
face
any
legal
liability
for
doing
so
During
the
debate
one
Virginia
legislator
relayed
a
story
of
a
constituent
who
had
fired
at
an
intruder
and
was
taken
to
court
for
doing
so
as
a
justification
for
the
law
But
Delegate
Anne
B
Crockett
Stark
Wythe
Republican
relayed
the
story
of
an
82
year
old
constituent
who
caught
a
male
burglar
in
her
home
one
time
held
a
gun
to
him
and
asked
Do
you
want
to
eat
breakfast
with
the
devil
Ms
Crockett
Stark
s
constituent
fired
at
the
intruder
as
he
ran
was
taken
to
court
and
lost
she
said
The
story
garnered
a
standing
ovation
from
the
crowd
Critics
of
the
measure
complained
that
it
was
already
accepted
practice
and
that
the
law
as
written
could
allow
homeowners
off
the
hook
for
using
deadly
force
indiscriminately
As
of
last
year
some
31
states
have
similar
laws
on
the
books
or
have
established
case
law
governing
the
use
of
deadly
force
in
the
home
including
Maryland
The
District
is
amongst
the
few
jurisdictions
in
the
country
with
no
explicit
law
on
the
matter

dcissound
I
understand
wanting
to
protect
yourself
and
if
someone
breaks
in
you
should
at
least
be
able
to
scare
them
off
with
a
gun
or
whatever
What
I
don
t
understand
is
if
the
robber
burglar
isn
t
trying
to
attack
you
in
the
story
he
is
running
away
why
would
it
be
ok
to
shoot
him
We
are
talking
about
personal
property
vs
a
human
life
If
someone
is
trying
to
harm
you
I
understand
defending
yourself
although
I
think
a
bat
or
a
hockey
stick
may
be
better
but
that
s
whatever
but
shooting
someone
who
is
running
away
with
you
with
the
intent
to
kill
when
their
only
intention
was
to
steal
your
jewelry
just
seems
wrong
HillmanDC
Quite
often
someone
that
breaks
into
a
house
rapes
the
inhabitant
It
s
not
just
a
theft
of
property
I
m
curious
Have
you
ever
been
the
victim
of
a
violent
crime
I
have
And
I
know
a
woman
that
was
the
victim
of
a
home
invasion
It
s
astonishingly
terrifying
Even
if
they
just
steal
some
jewelry
the
sense
of
violation
and
fear
is
profound
And
can
last
for
decades
afterward
It
is
for
most
literally
a
life
shattering
event

mail

Ollie
Pooeater
Given
all
the
hysteria
about
gun
owners
guns
more
likely
to
be
stolen
than
used
in
self
defense
do
you
really
want
someone
out
on
the
street
knowing
you
have
a
serviceable
weapon
in
your
house
It
almost
guarantees
a
repeat
offense
If
the
person
doesn
t
understand
don
t
fucking
move
until
the
cops
get
here
I
m
not
sure
letting
someone
run
away
does
anything
other
than
encourage
him
to
case
the
house
better
next
time

I
d
have
to
see
some
data
that
show
that
people
who
defended
their
homes
with
firearms
but
didn
t
shoot
to
kill
at
fleeing
intruders
where
more
likely
to
have
their
homes
broken
into
than
people
who
reflexively
shoot
to
kill
or
people
who
don
t
keep
guns
in
the
home
before
I
d
believe
that
restraining
from
shooting
someone
almost
guarantees
a
repeat
offense
Such
as
it
is
I
m
not
aware
of
any
systematic
problem
with
the
current
general
national
standard
that
requires
the
assailant
be
a
genuine
imminent
threat
to
the
homeowner
Ollie
Pooeater
I
couldn
t
even
get
through
your
initial
statement
without
a
migraine
developing
I
m
pretty
sure
that
makes
it
largely
untestable
But
it
would
be
an
interesting
study
dcissound
You
could
always
lock
your
gun
up
or
hide
it
I
think
there
is
a
big
difference
between
worrying
about
someone
possibly
coming
back
to
steal
your
gun
and
killing
someone
because
you
are
worried
they
may
attack
again
Ollie
Pooeater
People
can
t
argue
that
a
gun
is
more
likely
to
be
stolen
and
used
in
a
crime
on
one
hand
and
thus
justify
not
allowing
people
to
own
them
and
then
argue
that
a
thief
won
t
be
able
to
steal
your
gun
when
you
re
out
of
the
house
on
the
other
Also
you
can
t
successfully
hide
a
gun
make
it
useful
and
make
it
safe
The
three
are
incompatible
Anywhere
you
want
to
hide
that
s
successful
makes
it
unusable
when
you
need
it
DC
owners
are
required
to
lock
their
guns
at
all
times
if
it
s
not
under
your
immediate
control
and
if
there
s
anyone
under
18
in
the
house
paraphrasing
dcissound
Personally
I
don
t
think
the
situation
will
arise
often
it
enough
for
this
to
be
a
substantial
argument
My
initial
point
I
wanted
to
make
is
I
m
not
going
to
kill
people
over
an
attempted
theft
That
is
all
mappo
Sometimes
in
the
dark
of
night
it
s
hard
to
tell
if
that
person
in
your
living
room
is
one
of
those
take
your
diamonds
and
run
away
intruders
or
one
of
those
duct
tape
you
to
the
bedpost
and
set
the
house
on
fire
type
intruders
My
first
instict
would
be
to
shoot
not
ask
their
intentions
dcissound
The
point
I
was
trying
to
make
was
that
if
you
figure
out
their
intentions
like
in
the
story
why
continue
to
shoot
I
guess
I
m
just
the
type
of
person
that
doesn
t
want
to
kill
another
human
being
just
because
they
broke
into
my
house
Now
if
they
start
going
after
you
or
whatever
I
stated
I
had
no
problem
with
it
I
would
just
like
to
give
the
people
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
HillmanDC
At
what
point
do
you
know
their
intentions
And
how
do
you
know
they
don
t
have
three
of
their
heavily
armed
buddies
waiting
outside
the
house
waiting
to
be
let
in
through
that
very
door
that
the
home
invader
is
going
to
open
in
a
matter
of
seconds
A
cop
buddy
of
mine
tells
me
it
s
quite
common
for
people
that
break
into
a
house
to
have
the
little
guy
do
the
initial
window
break
or
whatnot
only
to
have
him
head
back
to
the
front
or
back
door
to
return
with
heavily
armed
backup
And
it
s
not
unheard
of
for
criminals
to
get
backup
immediately
to
kill
someone
that
saw
them
break
in
and
could
identify
them
Under
the
River
figure
out
their
intentions
Are
you
going
to
unload
the
gun
and
lock
it
up
just
because
they
told
you
what
you
wanted
to
hear
dcissound
I
m
sure
as
shit
not
going
to
kill
someone
for
breaking
into
my
house

St
Move
Next
time
there

burgluur

keeping

on
you
monkeyrotica
I
d
like
to
think
the
lock
on
my
door
is
a
clear
indication
that
I
m
not
interested
in
having
my
h
t
stolen
or
my
family
threatened
And
hey
if
I
see
someone
breaking
into
my
car
I
m
no
hero
I
ll
call
the
cops
before
I
start
messing
with
the
guy
But
if
I
find
you
inside
my
house
after
dark
I
don
t
give
a
h
t
which
direction
you
re
running
or
what
your
intention
is
That
isn
t
my
problem
St
Move
The
sort
of
person
who
breaks
into
a
house
while
someone
is
home
is
probably
one
circumstance
away
from
doing
something
horrific
to
an
innocent
person
anyway
If
you
break
into
a
house
you
can
t
expect
the
person
in
the
house
to
know
you
re
just
there
for
the
stuff
and
even
if
you
re
back
is
turned
you
can
t
expect
the
victim
to
know
you
re
not
just
going
down
the
hall
to
get
the
gimp
mask
Intruders
should
not
expect
to
leave
alive
It
s
a
key
part
of
the
social
contract
you
just
don
t
break
Or
err
end
up
brunching
with
Satan
or
whatever
it
was
RammyH
yes
I
was
going
to
post
something
similar
there
is
world
of
difference
between
an
opportunistic
burglar
who
tries
to
ascertain
that
a
home
is
empty
before
entering
and
burgling
and
the
burglar
who
breaks
into
homes
in
the
dead
of
night
knowing
full
well
the
house
s
occupants
are
sleeping
The
potential
for
catastrophe
escalation
is
huge
and
that
burglar
in
some
way
wants
that
escalation
they
can
claim
they
were
there
for
the
loot
but
once
that
occupant
adult
or
child
is
up
and
about
the
burglar
now
has
opportunity
to
bind
assault
rape
kill
the
home
dwellers
slim
pickens
Fake
sleeping
is
a
good
method
of
defense
If
the
robber
has
a
gun
I
m
a
lot
less
likely
to
get
shot
at
if
I
am
asleep
than
if
I
am
pointing
my
shaky
gun
at
him
and
freaking
out
ms
last
minute
I
think
about
this
a
lot
when
I
am
lying
in
bed
I
would
like
to
hear
the
stories
about
fake
sleeping

working

My
understanding
was
the
common
law
aspect
of
this
doesn
t
include
being
able
to
shoot
at
intruders
who
are
fleeing
the
scene
and
presumably
no
longer
a
threat
That
s
the
important
part
of
the

That
s
a
pretty
big
presumption
How
about
Don
t
break
into

and
expect
to
not

shot
How
about
that

Your
understanding
is
correct
It

in

Modestproposal1
Actually
they
re
amending
it
to
say
that
you
can
shoot
an
intruder
even
one
in
the
process
of
fleeing
that
poses
no
immediate
threat
but
you
have
to
say
a
really
badass

right
before
doing
it
otherwise
it

I

think
of
a

things
I
d
like
to
shoot
at
her

A

Because
nothing
says
justifiable
homicide
like
shooting
a
guy
in

as
he
s
running
away

Incidentally
running
away
could
just
as
easily
mean
running
out

to
get
three
of

to

pissed

shoot
him
in
the
f
king
face
Also
empty
the
ENTIRE

into

I
can
t
stress
that
enough
It
s
critical
that
the
judge

know
you
panicked
and
feared
for
your
life
You
don
t
want
to
be
the
on
the
wrong
end
of
a
lawsuit
from
the
family
of
an
aspiring
rapper
who
was
just
trying
to
get

After
weeks
of
out
of
the
ring
sparring
over
the
result
of
their
last
bout
D
C
native
Lamont
Peterson
and
Amir
Khan
will
battle
it
out
again
on
May
19
in
Las
Vegas
The
Post
reports
that
the
two
have
agreed
to
re
fight
the
December
match
that
Peterson
won
after
the
a
split
decision
by
the
judges
Khan
wasn
t
willing
to
let
the
super
lightweight
boxing
championship
belts
go
so
easily
though
he
complained
of
ring
side
shenanigans
and
filed
appeals
with
two
of
the
sport
s
governing
bodies
The
controversy
reached
such
a
fevered
pitch
that
a
D
C
Council
committee
went
so
far
as
to
hold
a
hearing
on
the
issue
last
week
hoping
to
head
off
any
damage
to
the
city
s
reputation
as
a
boxing
destination
It
s
no
surprise
though
that
the
rematch
won
t
be
happening
here
Regardless
of
the
outcome
it
looks
like
the
rematch
will
be
good
for
both
Peterson
and
Khan
the
Post
reports
that
they
ll
each
be
taking
home
1
5
million
just
for
stepping
into
the
ring
Part
of
the
agreement
also
stipulates
that
Peterson
s
next
fight
after
the
rematch
be
in
the
District
Predictably
Peterson
is
already
talking
some
good
trash
I
just
want
to
fight
him
again
because
it
was
a
good
fight
It
s
a
fight
that
the
fans
wanted
so
that
s
just
what
I
m
trying
to
focus
on
right
now
just
giving
the
fans
what
they
want
and
once
I
beat
him
again
I
just
don
t
want
to
hear
his
mouth
again

just

I
think
I
just
pulled
a
neck
muscle
shaking
my
head
knackers
I
say
good
luck
to
em
These
two
clowns
managed
to
turn
a
yawntastic
pseudo
title
fight
or
is
that
title
pseudo
fight
into
a
million
dollar
purse
in
Vegas
and
a
likely
re
rematch
in
DC
Waaahmbulance
Why
exactly
do
you
think
it
will
be
yawntastic
Also
do
you
think
all
boxers
are
clowns
or
is
there
something
in
particular
about
these
two
your
comment
was
not
entirely
clear
knackers
I
guess
I
meant
that
I
don
t
find
either
of
these
fighters
worth
all
the
fuss
that
has
been
made
I
thought
the
first
fight
was
something
of
a
snoozefest
and
I
predict
something
similar
for
the
Vegas
fight
There
have
been
some
excellent
junior
welterweight
champs
over
recent
years
I
just
don
t
see
these
guys
in
the
same
class
As
I
said
though
good
luck
to
them
if
they
each
get
a
mill
and
a
half
for
the
fight
slim
pickens
It
is
clear
that
he
was
referring
to
the
Convention
Center
fight
that
already
occurred
as
yawntastic
slim
pickens
Did
they
really
have
to
go
through
the
filing
of
bs
appeals
and
waste
people
s
time
to
get
to
what
was
clearly
the
intended
result
for
both
Hmm
I
guess
maybe
they
did
knackers
Boxing
these
days
is
like
wrestling
in
the
1980s

less

As

I
go

I

t
find
elsewhere

bulk
grains
I
bake
a

when
I
want
a
higher
quality
fresh
product
But
I
rarely
leave
that
store
less
than
50

In
my
experience
Whole

is
the
most
expensive
They
also
don

have
as

I
want
They
are
the
best

I
won
t
go
there
unless
I
have
the
extra
money
to
spend
which
is
rare
monkeyrotica
Like
every
other
grocery
it
depends
on
what
you
re
getting
Whole

has
some
good
deals
on
bulk
items
pastas
beans
and
the
like
The
heavily
processed
organic
items
like
frozen
dinners
and
imported
gourmet
items
like
cheese
are
steeper
I
tend
to
avoid
the

more
for

Same
Sex
Marriage
Debate
in
Maryland
Kicks
Off
Today
Gov
Martin
O
Malley
will
kick
off
the
debate
over
whether
or
not
to
legalize
same
sex
marriage
today
in
the
Maryland
House
writes
the
Washington
Times
At
the
same
time
a
Republican
lawmaker
from
Anne
Arundel
County
is
expected
to
propose
a
constitutional
amendment
that
would
define
marriage
as
between
a
man
and
a
woman
Same
sex
marriage
made
it
through
the
Maryland
State
Senate
last
year
but
stalled
in
the
House
While
O
Malley
is
putting
more
muscle
behind
the
fight
this
year
it
still
remains
unsure
if
he
has
the
support
to
move
marriage
equality
a
step
further

it
did
last

Virginia
Closer
to
Allowing
Adoption
Agencies
to
Bar
Gay
Adoption
The
Virginia
State
Senate
voted
yesterday
on
legislation
that
would
allow
adoption
agencies
to
deny
placements
based
on
religious
or
moral
beliefs
reports
WTOP
Proponents
of
the
measure
say
the
conscience
clause
merely
protects
the
rights
of
private
adoption
agencies
while
opponents
say
it
is
simply
a
cover
for
the
state
to
stop
same
sex
couples
from
starting
families
After
the
District
legalized
same
sex
marriage
local
adoption
agencies
similarly
complained
that
they
would
have
to
place
children
with
same
sex
families
Catholic
Charities

received
money
from

AndrewInDC
As
in
most
things
of
my
life
I
recall
a
lesson
from
that
master
of
political
insight
George
Carlin
As
Carlin
observed
churches
a
tax
free
entity
making
quasi
political
observations
endorsements
and
pushing
agendas
he
retorted
Tax
these
fuckers
Let
em
pay
their
admission
price
like
everyone
else
a
precept
I
wholly
agree
with
By
the
same
token
entities
which
are
already
being
taxed
and
thus
paying
their
admission
price
ought
to
be
able
to
get
a
say
for
positions
that
affect
them
as
an
entity
Individuals
should
not
have
to
pony
up
their
own
money
to
support
positions
that
their
company
is
taking
You
re
saying
it
s
giving
them
two
votes
I
m
saying
it
s
giving
them
a
vote
with
the
proper
voice
the
corporation
s
This
also
goes
for
unions
grass
roots
issue
driven
organizations
etc
although
the
mechanics
and
arguments
are
different
e
g
by
paying
dues
they
re
already
ponying
up
their
own
money
to
support
positions

Whatever
a
corporation
spends
on
electioneering
they
are
still
not
capable
of
voting
At
the
end
of
the
day
it
comes
down
to
a
human
being
judging
the
different
messages
and
making
a
choice
The
problem
is
that
the
IQ
and
attention
span
of
the
average
voter
is
miniscule
They
vote
for
the
same
thing
same
people
because
they
re
lazy
If
you
want
to
ban
privately
financed
elections
you
can
do
that
but
you
can
t
effectively
ban
financed
speech
nor
would
you
want
to
greent6
We
are
not
talking
about
participating
in
the
marketplace
of
ideas
We
are
talking
about
corporate
contributions
to
candidates
for
voting
electioneering
purposes
So
a
corporation
that
cannot
vote
can
spend
untold
sums
influencing
the
voting
process
And
that
means
a
corporation
or
union
or
church
is
provided
the
means
to
have
more
influence
on
the
election
than
the
individual
people
responsible
for
participating
in
it
I
am
not
saying
that
the
citizens
United
idea
of
free
press
speech
for
an
entity
is
incorrect
I
am
saying
that
corporations
should
not
be
allowed
to
donate
money
to
candidates
greent6
Nope
I
am
saying
Entities
are
not
people
Only
people
are
citizens
Only
citizens
may
vote
Citizens
may
only
vote
once
AndrewInDC
But
we
re
not
really
talking
about
voting
we
re
talking
about
participating
in
the
marketplace
of
ideas
In
that
regard
an
editorial
is
a
commercial
is
a
movie
is
an
advert
is
a
grassroots
organizer
going
door
to
door
with
flyers
all
of
them
are
pushing
agendas
and
they
re
all
driven
and
funded
by
a
collective
action
of
a
freely
associated
assembly
You
re
arguing
that
an
individual
has
a
right
to
speak
up
but
other
entities
do
not
which
is
interesting
but
untenable
The
reason
Citizens
United
won
is
because
its
impossible
to
legally
differentiate
between
the
freedom
of
speech
and
press
permitted
to
the
general
public
vice
its
collective
entities
nor
should
they
try
We
participate
in
collective
action
to
do
things
an
individual
would
otherwise
have
insufficient
wherewithal
to
do
greent6
Well
as
corporations
are
people
now
how
the
hell
did
that
happen
People
can
t
choose
to
marry
other
people
but
a
corporation
is
a
person
who
can
give
money
to
candidates
and
influence
elections
yet
that
corporatin
cannot
vote
So
really
this
is
just
a
way
to
give
board
members
and
CEO
s
more
than
one
vote
Reason

they

This

Despite
a
unanimous
vote
in
support
of
a
five
cent
bag
fee
in
the
Prince
George
s
County
Council
this
week
a
Maryland
State
House
committee
voted
the
proposal
down
yesterday
The
Post
reports
that
the
widespread
support
shown
on
the
council
did
not
extend
to
the
Prince
George
s
County
delegation
to
the
State
House
causing
the
measure
to
fail
The
bill
needed
broader
support
from
the

Voting
for

besides

were

The
measure
can
come
before
the
panel
two
more
times
and
the
full
delegation
could
take
it
up
even
without
the
panel
s
endorsement
What
provoked
the
opposition
Lobbying
from
plastic
bag
manufacturers
and
concerns
that
the
fee
would
hurt
low
income
residents
Both
the
District
and
Montgomery
County
have
imposed
five
cent
bag
fees
and
Maryland
is
considering
a
statewide
measure
doing
the
same
But
without
Prince
George
s
County
onboard
it
s
unclear
whether
or
not
it
will
pass
UPDATE

a
m
Not
all
hope
is
lost
though
People
with
knowledge
of
the
issue
note
that
another
vote
is
coming
and
the
House
committee
could
eventually
vote
for
the
bag
fee
Saying
the
bill
is
dead
is
simply
not
true
That
3
2
vote
was
in
favor
we
just
needed
4
votes
to
get
the
stamp
of
approval
from
County
Affairs
It
still
can
move
forward
without
that
approval
and
it
gets
another
chance
to
get
the
approval
next
week
Perpetuating
the
idea
that
the
bill
is
dead
is
really
hurting
our
effort

Between

there
s
been
a

of

today
about
how
I

If

getting

PG

its

I

they

Baggage
Surcharge
for
Taxicabs
Reinstated
in
Fare
Proposal
Photo
by
Chris
Reif
The
D
C
Taxicab
Commission
announced
yesterday
that
it
would
restore
a
baggage
handling
surcharge
that
it
had
originally
removed
from
a
fare
increase
proposal
that
will
likely
take
effect
in
the
coming
months
Under
the
current
fare
structure
riders
can
be
charged
50
cents
for
every
bag
above
and
beyond
a
first
one
which
rides
for
free
while
trunks
cost
2
each
As
part
of
a
fare
increase
proposal
presented
by
the
commission
in
December
per
mile
rates
would
increase
from
1
50
to
2
16
but
most
of
the
existing
surcharges
would
be
scrapped
including
the
baggage
and
trunk
surcharges
That
news
angered
many
drivers
who
claim
that
the
only
thing
sustaining
them
is
those
very
surcharges
At
yesterday
s
hearing
Commissioner
Ron
Linton
said
that
he
had
taken
into
consideration
driver
and
rider
comments
in
reinstating
the
baggage
fee
The
new
fee
won
t
apply
to
bags
of
groceries
purses
or
similar
type
bags
and
Linton
said
it
would
only
apply
to
bags
that
are
physically
handled
by
a
driver
The
trunk
surcharge
remains
out
of
the
new
proposal
Linton
also
reinstated
a
1
additional
passenger
charge
but
only
for
vans
and
allowed
drivers
the
means
to
gain
an
exemption
to
a
rule
that
allow
passengers
to
carry
small
animals
with
them
but
only
if
the
driver
can
show
proof
of
an
allergy
Additionally
the
commission
included
a
15
flat
fee
to
metered
rates
during
snow
emergencies
currently
a
cab
driver
can
charge
125
percent
of
the
regular
fare
during
a
snow
emergency
The
amended
fare
increase
proposal
will
again
be
published
in
the
D
C
Register
where
it
will
be
open
to
30
days
of
public
comment

I
thought
the

were

upon

go

end
up

D
Rez
Why
yes
Let
s
introduce
additional
complexity
and
ambiguity
into
the
fee
structure
for
a
service
used
by
many
visitors
What
could
possibly
be
wrong
with
that
DCTransplant
If
I
m
going
to
get
charged
for
bag
handling
then
I
ll
will
make
damn
sure
that
the
cab
driver
gets
off
his
ass
and
handles
my
bag
I
feel
dirty
just
having
said
that
ms
last
minute
I
have
NEVER
had
a
cab
driver
get
out
of
the
cab
to
help
me
with
my
luggage
It
is
a
chore
to
get
them
to
press
a
button
and
open
the
trunk
St
Move
When
the
charge
was
in
effect
I
would
just
say
get
my
bags
and
sit
in
the
back
seat
as
if
I
were
a
royal
It
seemed
justified
for
2
a
bag
If
this
new
fee
means
they
will
charge
me
50
for
a
backpack
or
laptop
bag
in
the
seat
with
me
then
I
will
drop
it
on
the
curb
and
force
them
to
hand
it
to
me
while
I
clean
my
monocle

And
tap
on

JC
Hey
crack
journalism
team
what
is
the
new
fee
for
luggage
under
the
proposed
structure
That
seems
to
be
the
most
important
detail
in
this
story

I
can

find
it
anywhere
Thanks

Using
Feng
Shui
Interior
Design
http

As
many
of
you
will
be
aware
Feng
Shui
is
the
study
and
analysis
of
the
interaction
between
people
buildings
and
the
environment
and
can
be
used
to
enhance
our
quality
of
life
According
to
Feng
Shui
experts
the
atmosphere
or
chi
of
a
building
and
its
close
surroundings
have
an
influence
upon
our
life
patterns
and
outcomes
By
getting
the
Feng
Shui
in
our
homes
right
we
are
able
to
create
a
supportive
environment
that
can
help
us
to
succeed
and
flourish
in
our
homes
and
work
spaces
But
how
exactly
does
Feng
Shui
work
and
what
is
the
best
way
to
go
about
creating
a
happy
healthy
and
harmonious
home
using
Feng
Shui
In
order
to
answer
these
questions
we
consulted
Feng
Shui
Master
Sarah
McAllister
who
founded
the
UK
based
Feng
Shui
Agency
back
in
2003
Sarah
has
14
years
Feng
Shui
experience
and
a
number
of
prestigious
UK
and
international
Feng
Shui
projects
in
her
portfolio
and
is
founder
of
the
first
Chue
Feng
Shui
school
to
be
accredited
by
the
Feng
Shui
Society
UK
She
has
been
very
influential
in
introducing
Feng
Shui
to
the
more
conventional
and
mainstream
of
society
rather
than
the
more
new
age
audience
that
it
is
readily
associated
with
Can
you
please
start
by
telling
us
about
the
Feng
Shui
Agency
SM
This
is
a
unique
company
established
by
me
in
2003
incorporated
in
2005
with
a
dual
focus
on
both
Feng
Shui
design
consultancy
and
teaching
We
are
recognised
as
the
first
Feng
Shui
Interior
Design
and
Feng
Shui
Architecture
company
in
the
UK
and
we
are
based
in
London
and
Oxford
We
have
clients
from
all
over
the
world
and
increasingly
work
internationally
including
places
like
Moscow
Tokyo
Milan
and
Dubai
to
name
but
a
few
places
we
have
projects
We
have
also
established
the
Feng
Shui
Agency
Chue
Style
School
which
reflects
the
fact
that
we
practice
and
teach
mostly
Chue
Style
Feng
Shui
which
has
a
lineage
all
the
way
back
to
the
Imperial
Courts
of
China
I
am
the
main
Feng
Shui
consultant
and
work
closely
with
other
Feng
Shui
expert
colleagues
as
demand
requires
I
have
personally
fully
trained
a
few
graduates
to
represent
me
on
smaller
jobs
as
required
I
like
to
keep
flexibility
in
the
team
so
I
currently
do
not
employ
anyone
But
I
do
have
a
couple
of
great
interior
designers
and
architects
who
help
me
as
the
need
arises
on
those
projects
requiring
full
architectural
or
interior
design
The
business
is
highly
mobile
and
once
we
have
done
the
first
site
visit
we
can
work
from
anywhere
in
the
world
depending
on
the
follow
up
requirements
of
each
individual
project
Some
projects
need
regular
site
visits
and
other
commissions
can
be
carried
out
remotely
You
established
the
Agency
in
2003
but
how
did
you
first
become
interested
in
Feng
Shui
SM
I
first
became
interested
in
Feng
Shui
at
the
age
of
14
possibly
even
earlier
as
I
was
always
the
kid
lingering
the
longest
in
nature
and
zoning
out
in
a
meditative
space
I
used
to
regularly
re
arrange
my
bedroom
trying
out
new
positions
for
the
bed
and
lighting
etc
My
father
used
to
teach
Judo
in
his
spare
time
so
I
was
on
the
mats
in
the
dojo
from
about
age
four
and
at
home
were
plenty
of
books
on
Judo
Tai
Chi
and
Karate
I
also
learned
Wado
Ryu
Karate
and
Wing
Chun
Kung
Fu
as
a
hobby
I
was
immersed
in
Eastern
principles
from
very
young
age
What
do
the
words
Feng
Shui
actually
mean
and
where
does
it
originate
from
SM
Feng
means
wind
and
Shui
means
water
and
this
relates
to
both
the
physical
masses
of
water
lake
ocean
river
etc
and
the
winds
but
is
also
a
metaphor
for
earth
energy
water
and
heaven
energy
wind
moving
on
and
around
the
planet
we
inhabit
Lets
face
it
the
world
is
an
organic
being
not
just
a
map
which
we
walk
drive
eat
and
sleep
upon
I
think
the
green
movement
has
been
wonderful
for
Feng
Shui
as
people
are
realising
now
more
than
ever
how
the
world
is
sentient
and
interconnected
and
how
we
treat
our
space
directly
affects
us
The
idea
with
Feng
Shui
is
to
gather
the
energy
for
our
health
and
happiness
and
activate
or
disperse
it
gently
with
the
wind
Where
you
find
water
you
will
find
life
and
the
heaven
energy
is
also
held
by
the
water
wind
slows
down
when
contacting
water
Architects
I
have
worked
with
have
acknowledged
the
power
of
water
as
they
understand
how
it
emits
negative
ions
which
attract
the
human
energy
field
and
why
many
people
feel
happier
after
a
shower
a
thunder
storm
with
rain
etc
as
the
water
has
a
cleansing
and
revitalising
effect
Can
you
describe
the
purpose
of
Feng
Shui
SM
Originally
Feng
Shui
was
used
primarily
for
health
as
it
is
one
of
the
8
Brocades
of
Chinese
Medicine
including
Acupuncture
Meditation
Herbalism
Nutrition
Tuina
Massage
Tai
Chi
Chi
Kung
and
Astrology
Originating
mostly
in
rural
China
by
farmers
who
needed
to
understand
nature
to
give
them
the
best
chance
of
successful
crops
the
knowledge
was
then
perceived
by
the
travelling
scholars
who
brought
it
back
to
the
Imperial
Courts
of
China
where
astrologers
astronomers
and
political
advisors
started
to
develop
the
rudimentary
systems
and
sought
to
use
it
to
help
the
Emperor
s
rule
Over
the
years
it
then
became
popular
in
business
and
politics
and
no
one
can
argue
about
the
enormous
success
of
Hong
Kong
as
a
financial
capital
and
this
is
very
much
based
on
Feng
Shui
Although
Feng
Shui
originated
in
China
it
is
universally
applicable
and
does
not
require
people
to
understand
Chinese
folklore
in
fact
there
is
still
a
group
of
Feng
Shui
consultants
throughout
the
East
that
perpetuate
superstitious
nonsense
because
they
haven
t
had
the
right
training
They
don
t
help
the
public
relations
of
the
industry
and
of
course
the
press
love
to
pick
up
on
the
failings
of
these
people
How
can
incorporating
the
principles
of
Feng
Shui
into
our
homes
help
us
to
live
a
better
life
SM
Feng
Shui
is
not
just
about
techniques
to
try
to
master
a
situation
and
improve
your
fortune
but
at
a
deeper
level
it
is
also
about
your
soul
and
its
journey
It
isn
t
just
about
how
to
maximise
your
luck
all
the
time
for
your
own
gain
but
it
is
also
about
asking
yourself
how
you
can
contribute
to
the
world
For
example
it
could
be
that
a
high
ranking
official
asks
my
advice
on
his
or
her
horoscope
and
I
say
that
actually
they
would
be
happier
as
a
yoga
instructor
or
whatever
the
situation
that
is
a
stereotypical
example
If
clients
can
engage
with
the
deeper
thread
of
what
is
being
offered
then
I
can
support
them
and
their
families
over
years
rather
than
one
off
consultations
This
is
my
preferred
business
model
as
it
rewards
me
for
being
extra
committed
to
them
and
it
rewards
the
client
because
they
have
access
to
wonderful
knowledge
and
our
able
to
implement
the
knowledge
more
often
in
their
lives
Your
services
can
help
people
create
a
space
that
is
entirely
customised
to
their
own
unique
energy
constitution
from
the
colours
on
the
walls
to
the
layouts
of
the
rooms
materials
and
orientation
of
beds
desks
sofas
etc
How
do
you
go
about
discerning
somebody
s
energy
constitution
And
how
does
this
relate
to
the
layout
and
colour
scheme
of
their
house
SM
Each
one
of
us
has
a
unique
blueprint
and
there
are
many
factors
that
go
into
an
assessment
but
it
is
primarily
the
year
month
date
and
hour
of
birth
which
creates
the
Ba
Zi
Four
Pillars
horoscope
This
provides
astonishingly
accurate
detail
on
a
person
s
ability
to
marry
conceive
have
a
good
career
be
healthy
and
wealthy
have
personal
and
official
power
etc
Most
of
life
s
issues
and
concerns
can
be
seen
in
the
horoscope
through
the
interplay
of
the
Five
Elements
of
Water
Wood
Fire
Earth
and
Metal
We
then
take
this
information
and
where
possible
combine
it
with
the
Feng
Shui
readings
so
that
the
clients
sleep
in
the
best
room
face
the
best
way
when
working
from
home
etc
This
is
a
good
place
to
point
out
that
many
people
can
and
will
do
well
whatever
position
they
sleep
or
work
in
and
Feng
Shui
must
not
be
considered
the
be
all
and
end
all
It
is
simply
a
tool
to
use
if
a
client
wishes
to
maintain
or
improve
upon
their
existing
success
by
tapping
in
to
this
wisdom
Or
it
can
help
someone
who
seeks
our
advice
because
life
isn
t
going
how
they
want
it
and
they
keep
on
having
persistent
bad
luck
bad
health
or
they
are
unhappy
in
this
case
we
look
to
alleviate
unnecessary
suffering
by
figuring
out
if
their
Feng
Shui
is
hindering
them
or
not
I
make
it
very
clear
from
the
point
of
enquiry
that
Feng
Shui
accounts
for
approx
30
influence
on
your
overall
luck
levels
and
that
it
isn
t
a
cure
all
and
I
don
t
profess
unrealistic
benefits
I
also
adopt
a
very
supportive
coaching
style
so
that
the
clients
don
t
feel
neurotic
about
their
space
Many
have
contacted
me
as
they
have
read
a
few
books
and
I
quite
often
reassure
them
about
certain
aspects
of
their
home
It
goes
to
show
that
reading
a
book
can
turn
people
into
armchair
practitioners
for
whom
a
little
knowledge
is
dangerous
Your
company
offers
a
consultation
service
giving
practical
advice
helping
people
to
improve
the
Feng
Shui
in
their
homes
What
analysis
methods
do
you
use
during
your
consultation
process
and
what
are
the
most
common
problems
that
you
come
across
SM
We
start
outside
having
a
look
around
the
immediate
area
for
problematic
or
supportive
features
in
the
nearby
environment
such
as
pylons
power
plants
excessively
tall
trees
etc
and
figure
out
if
these
are
affecting
the
client
s
property
and
if
a
cure
needs
to
be
put
in
place
which
would
then
be
worked
out
in
conjunction
with
other
exterior
techniques
I
aim
to
achieve
one
action
for
three
reasons
or
one
suggestion
for
three
results
because
Feng
Shui
takes
a
truly
holistic
look
at
the
property
Then
we
move
inside
and
meet
the
client
having
already
figured
out
how
the
physical
form
is
affecting
the
property
Following
a
quick
chat
with
client
during
which
we
reestablish
their
goals
and
how
I
can
help
I
start
at
the
back
of
property
and
look
again
at
exterior
influences
as
these
are
60
of
the
influence
on
a
property
with
a
garden
Only
once
I
have
received
an
instinctive
impression
of
the
property
and
the
client
will
I
then
proceed
to
the
measurements
taken
with
the
Chinese
Lopan
Compass
like
any
other
compass
it
aligns
to
magnetic
north
and
is
much
more
accurate
than
a
mobile
phone
app
compass
The
orientation
of
the
property
tells
us
certain
information
based
on
specialist
techniques
The
most
common
problems
that
I
m
brought
in
to
help
with
are
relationship
issues
bickering
kids
and
adults
sleeping
poorly
feeling
drained
career
confusion
lack
of
clients
poor
health
or
kids
getting
into
trouble
at
school
with
authority
figures
or
peers
Also
people
like
to
get
me
involved
when
they
move
to
a
new
house
or
office
with
our
Property
Selection
Service
and
when
they
are
building
a
new
building
or
refurbishing
extending
an
existing
one
They
want
to
get
off
on
the
right
foot
and
if
spending
100
000
on
a
refurbishment
of
course
they
want
to
make
sure
the
colours
and
layouts
and
landscaping
are
Feng
Shui
optimised
so
they
don
t
have
to
redo
everything
Businesses
also
contact
me
to
seek
advice
on
finding
a
good
new
office
premises
Are
there
any
rooms
in
the
house
that
are
more
important
to
get
right
and
if
so
why
SM
Realistically
you
need
only
concern
yourself
with
spaces
where
you
or
your
family
spend
a
significant
amount
of
time
like
the
bedrooms
home
study
and
kitchen
I
am
a
strong
believer
that
Feng
Shui
needs
to
be
practical
in
its
application
and
I
seek
to
support
clients
in
understanding
the
important
solutions
and
recommendations
and
that
they
need
not
worry
about
every
last
tiny
detail
of
a
space
Can
you
please
tell
us
about
a
project
you
have
worked
on
recently
that
you
considered
to
be
most
interesting
and
why
was
that
SM
In
November
I
started
advising
on
an
Ecobulid
project
near
Bath
in
Wiltshire
in
the
UK
which
was
quite
challenging
because
the
designs
had
already
been
approved
by
local
planners
and
even
though
I
proposed
some
changes
to
see
if
the
designs
could
be
approved
it
would
have
involved
a
lot
of
architectural
re
drawing
so
the
client
just
accepted
that
I
would
try
to
fix
any
problems
without
too
much
upheaval
to
the
design
I
worked
hard
to
find
solutions
that
could
be
implemented
to
improve
the
Feng
Shui
The
site
was
on
a
level
plateau
which
then
sloped
away
quite
steeply
so
I
suggested
a
Flowform
water
feature
to
help
keep
the
chi
from
dropping
away
and
also
to
activate
a
good
double
mountain
as
we
call
it
in
terms
of
directions
I
also
had
to
find
places
for
the
extensive
external
art
collection
of
the
client
ranging
from
ironcast
lions
to
coloured
glass
panels
and
a
Degas
ballet
dancer
I
also
advised
placing
an
uplit
Buddha
towards
the
rear
of
the
property
Internally
I
managed
to
get
the
front
door
changed
to
a
better
angle
and
changed
from
double
doors
to
single
and
to
get
the
right
colours
in
the
interiors
white
or
white
with
hint
of
green
I
also
insisted
on
changes
to
the
shape
of
the
artist
studio
outhouse
which
would
otherwise
have
been
very
detrimental
to
the
woman
wanting
to
work
in
it
I
also
helped
design
the
reflection
pool
just
outside
the
living
area
which
will
look
stunning
and
suit
a
Feng
Shui
purpose
too
It
was
an
interesting
project
because
it
challenged
me
to
be
creative
in
my
solutions
to
what
was
quite
a
fixed
situation
and
it
was
gratifying
that
the
clients
interior
designer
and
architect
who
were
all
very
open
and
positive
about
Feng
Shui
Ideally
I
would
have
been
commissioned
at
the
very
outset
but
some
positive
changes
are
better
than
none
at
all
I
am
an
optimist
essentially
For
people
living
in
rental
accommodation
where
drastically
modifying
the
layout
of
the
house
is
not
an
option
how
else
can
the
principles
of
Feng
Shui
be
used
to
create
a
positive
environment
within
the
house
SM
People
renting
can
commission
a
property
selection
service
so
that
they
are
signing
up
for
a
property
that
suits
them
from
a
Feng
Shui
perspective
if
this
is
the
case
then
what
they
do
inside
is
less
important
because
the
main
frame
of
the
accommodation
suits
them
They
can
also
position
freestanding
items
such
as
lights
statues
if
appropriate
not
in
case
of
Muslim
clients
plants
beds
desks
etc
so
that
they
are
at
least
benefiting
as
much
as
possible
even
if
they
can
t
repaint
the
room
or
afix
things
to
walls
etc
Obviously
they
are
more
limited
than
homeowners
but
can
still
benefit
from
the
advice
of
an
expert
I
don
t
advocate
DIY
Feng
Shui
as
it
is
potentially
dangerous
Not
everybody
can
afford
to
hire
a
Feng
Shui
Consultant
or
get
advice
from
a
professional
such
as
yourself
What
can
people
do
to
learn
more
about
the
benefits
of
Feng
Shui
and
how
it
can
help
improve
both
their
homes
and
their
lives
SM
Feng
Shui
is
not
a
self
help
or
DIY
topic
as
it
is
so
deep
and
complex
so
people
can
gain
only
very
limited
skill
through
reading
a
few
books
in
their
free
time
More
often
than
not
books
cause
people
confusion
and
despair
The
heart
of
Feng
Shui
is
mastering
natural
energies
therefore
it
is
exceptionally
powerful
which
is
why
the
best
professionals
train
for
many
years
to
master
the
skill
and
are
continually
learning
more
There
is
both
a
scientific
and
method
based
aspect
and
also
intuition
that
develops
and
refines
over
years
of
experience
If
people
can
afford
holidays
nice
handbags
etc
then
they
can
save
towards
a
consultation
it
is
just
a
question
of
priorities
and
their
ranking
of
values
For
those
in
genuine
financial
hardship
we
offer
student
consultations
where
I
visit
a
home
or
office
with
my
students
to
allow
them
practical
experience
in
a
real
life
situation
The
host
benefits
from
the
feedback
from
the
students
plus
I
give
some
more
advanced
advice
if
I
deem
it
necessary
to
help
them
What
are
your
top
Feng
Shui
dos
and
don
ts
SM
DOs
Do
consult
with
a
Feng
Shui
expert
BEFORE
applying
for
planning
permission
or
working
with
an
architect
as
only
minor
changes
can
be
made
once
planning
has
been
approved
Do
keep
your
front
garden
clear
of
debris
and
keep
seasonal
flowers
in
tubs
year
round
The
front
of
a
property
is
the
face
keep
it
pretty
Keep
the
front
door
of
a
building
shiny
and
new
polish
door
furniture
to
a
shine
the
door
is
the
mouth
of
chi
so
it
needs
to
be
well
maintained
When
looking
for
a
new
home
try
to
find
one
with
a
good
view
at
the
front
and
a
quiet
settled
energy
at
the
back
there
are
exceptions
to
this
but
it
is
a
good
start
Do
use
full
spectrum
bulbs
in
work
areas
and
kitchens
as
their
light
is
so
much
healthier
DON
TS
Don
t
ignore
the
characteristics
of
the
surrounding
area
when
designing
a
new
build
Don
t
consider
Feng
Shui
as
only
applying
to
interiors
It
is
mostly
about
the
exterior
and
the
shape
of
house
The
interiors
come
second
once
the
shape
and
orientation
has
been
considered
properly
Don
t
use
too
much
black
and
red
together
as
an
interior
theme
as
it
can
cause
male
female
arguments
Avoid
overly
stimulating
colours
in
a
bedroom
such
as
red
and
orange
as
these
are
not
conducive
to
sleep
and
relaxation
If
you
need
spice
in
the
bedroom
go
to
a
Las
Vegas
hotel
for
a
weekend
Don
t
place
large
amounts
of
water
in
your
design
internal
or
external
without
consulting
a
Feng
Shui
expert
What
would
you
say
to
the
sceptics
who
believe
that
Feng
Shui
is
a
load
of
nonsense
SM
Don
t
ridicule
something
that
you
haven
t
tried
or
haven
t
studied
in
depth
They
would
be
advised
to
remember
that
quantum
physicists
are
proving
time
and
time
again
that
the
ancient
beliefs
from
many
indigenous
peoples
that
were
previously
considered
superstitious
or
primitive
are
now
being
shown
to
be
very
sophisticated
and
correct
It
is
actually
astoundingly
simple
the
world
is
simply
an
arrangement
of
energy
whether
human
animal
mineral
physical
energetic
emotional
mental
etc
The
environmental
energy
surrounding
us
is
linked
to
our
own
psyche
and
energy
field
and
can
affect
us
for
good
or
for
bad
Feng
Shui
seeks
to
combine
the
human
with
nature
and
help
to
create
a
supportive
environment
In
2007
I
did
a
diploma
in
Environmental
Psychology
at
Birkbeck
College
in
London
as
I
wanted
to
learn
whether
the
principles
of
Feng
Shui
could
be
explained
with
the
more
westernised
language
of
Environmental
Psychology
and
there
are
many
parallels
Of
course
our
environment
affects
us
or
why
would
we
be
interested
in
aesthetics
or
certain
colour
palettes
or
art
of
opera
Sound
music
colour
space
it
all
works
together
to
form
our
environment
influencing
our
perception
and
therefore
our
feelings
and
thoughts
which
have
a
significant
impact
on
our
ability
to
be
healthy
harmonious
and
wealthy
The
macro
environment
of
our
homes
offices
etc
affects
the
micro
environment
of
our
own
body
and
mind
If
you
were
to
give
one
tip
to
Freshome
readers
for
something
that
they
could
try
at
home
which
would
allow
them
to
test
the
benefits
of
Feng
Shui
what
would
it
be
SM
There
isn
t
really
one
tip
to
apply
to
all
situations
as
depending
on
the
sickness
a
different
remedy
is
prescribed
Reducing
Feng
Shui
to
tips
is
like
asking
a
brain
surgeon
to
give
their
top
tip
on
how
to
remove
a
clot
on
the
brain
it
is
impossible
without
the
audience
having
gone
through
medical
school
Similarly
with
Feng
Shui
the
layperson
simply
hasn
t
had
the
training
required
to
understand
the
more
powerful
techniques
of
Feng
Shui
so
the
tips
inevitably
end
up
sounding
rather
simplistic
and
do
not
do
the
subject
justice
In
fact
some
tips
can
be
dangerous
which
is
why
I
try
to
keep
mine
on
my
blog
as
generic
as
possible
and
will
not
tell
people
anything
they
can
t
handle
as
it
is
not
responsible
and
could
potentially
damage
someone
But
one
piece
of
advice
that
everyone
can
put
into
practice
and
is
safe
to
use
is
to
make
sure
you
have
a
nice
high
headboard
behind
your
bed
You
d
be
amazed
how
many
people
move
in
to
a
house
and
forget
to
buy
the
headboard
It
creates
an
important
stability
to
the
bed
that
is
psychologically
reassuring
even
if
mostly
subconscious
Yes
you
can
get
by
without
one
but
it
is
far
nicer
and
far
more
supportive
to
have
one
For
those
of
you
who
wish
to
learn
more

Transforming
a
1960
s
split
level
building
into
a
fascinating
contemporary
residence
resulted
in
a
beautiful
combination
of
old
flare
and
new
sophistication
Moore
Architects
managed
to
create
a
stunning
collection
of
spaces
gathered
in
a
home
named
Lakefront
Residence
As
described
by
the
architects
this
home
is
organized
according
to
the
owner
s
needs
while
taking
into
account
the
existing
building
Saving
the
bones
of
the
front
to
back
split
level
the
architects
sought
to
use
this
basic
organization
to
an
advantage
exploiting
the
street
side
water
side
split
personality
of
the
residence
but
acknowledging
that
the
fun
is
in
the
modern
connection
of
the
two
worlds
The
landscaped
street
face
of
the
house
containing
the
entry
office
garage
and
guest
rooms
recalls
the
reserve
and
scale
of
the
original
house
The
rear
of
the
house
with
the
living
and
dining
rooms
and
master
suite
explodes
into
the
woods
opening
views
to
the
steep
hill
that
plummets
to
the
water
below
Spreading
over
4
900
square
feet
the
remodeled
house
is
located
in
Falls
Church
Virginia
USA
Overlooking
the
private
Lake
Barcroft
this
unique
L
shaped
home
provides
the
inhabitants
with
a
fantastic
back
terrace
and
a
landscape
adorned
with
mature
maple
trees
Indoor
and
outdoor
merge
in
a
successful
effort
to
bring
a
sense
of
living
alongside
nature
but
having
all
the
modern
comfort
needed
by
urban
dwellers

A
spectacular
open
plan
residence
named
the
AE
House
was
constructed
in
Lomas
de
Chapultepec
Mexico
City
Placed
on
a
8
611
square
feet
property
the
modern
house
rises
up
three
levels
in
order
to
offer
its
inhabitants
all
the
necessary
room
to
live
a
modern
comfortable
life
The
architects
who
worked
on
this
project
twentyfourseven
describe
the
site
s
challenges
and
solutions
they
came
up
with
The
proposal
of
the
project
changes
this
interaction
by
displacing
a
thick
volume
to
the
back
of
the
site
while
a
thin
volume
is
pulled
forward
creating
by
such
an
action
a
cross
diagram
that
allows
for
patios
to
emerge
with
views
illumination
and
natural
ventilation
of
the
spaces
The
intersection
of
both
volumes
creates
a
central
void
where
the
connection
between
the
different
volumes
opens
up
to
the
sky
Defined
by
glass
walls
on
the
ground
floor
the
living
spaces
are
opened
to
the
outside
space
The
living
spaces
sit
between
the
frontal
garden
and
the
back
gravel
patio
a
131
feet
long
space
dedicated
to
family
life
Having
placed
the
kitchen
and
services
in
such
a
way
as
to
relate
to
both
the
formal
and
the
everyday
dining
spaces
the
architects
designed
the
upper
levels
as
a
collection
of
private
spaces
overlooking
the
garden
with
Jacarandas
and
Palm
trees
Luxurious
in
its
simplicity
the
AE
House
was
constructed
as

space

La

is
a
massive
residence
designed
by
studio

Arquitectes
and
located
in
Caldes
de
Malavella
Spain
This
4
560
square
foot
two
story
modern
home
has
a
design
based
on
a
strong
indoor
outdoor
connection
All
the
patios
and
porches
seem
to
extend
outwards
slowly
fading
into
the
natural
landscape
According
to
the
architects
the
vision
for
this
home
is
laid
out
around
a
series
of
symbolic
spaces
in
homage
to
a
Mediterranean
country
villa
The
home
is
accessed
from
an
elevated
patio
reinstating
the
main
carriage
entrances
of
the
Palladian
villas
The
terrace
offers
magnificent
views
over
the
golf
course
extending
the
vista
from
the
living
room
and
making
it
a
privileged
vantage
point
overlooking
the
landscape
Protected
from
view
and
occupying
a
dominant
position
the
swimming
pool
blends
beautifully
with
the
house
in
a
spectacular
bathing
area
in
which

The
East
Market
House
was
designed
by
COOP15
and
is
located
in
Kirkland
s
East
of
Market
neighborhood
in
Seattle
The
residence
is
adapted
to
the
urban
character
of
this
part
of
town
and
displays
a
highly
modern
design
According
to
the
architects
living
spaces
are
tightly
organized
and
vertical
stacked
over
the
garage
with
a
shifting
geometry
between
floors
creating
a
more
dynamic
form
and
living
spaces
That
shifting
language
continues
with
the
built
in
cabinetry
in
the
kitchen
and
at
the
large
central
stair
and
wall
The
stair
wall
along
with
a
simple
singular
accent
color
ties
the
three
stories
together
creating
a
datum
around
which
other
programmatic
elements
align
Materials
are
tough
and
weatherproof
with
limited
use
of
natural
wood
accents
A
green
roof
sits
atop
a
main
floor
bedroom
drawing
the
landscape
up
into
the
stacked
forms
of
the
architecture

Greatest
architects
famous
buildings
and
legendary
quotes
these
are
just
some
of
the
modern
architecture
fields
you
will
have
to
discover
and
overcome
in
the
questions
addressed
by
The
Modern
Architecture
Game
Developed
by
Next
Architects
this
captivating
means
of
socializing
tests
your
knowledge
with
no
less
than
1000
modern
architecture
questions
According
to
Next
The
Modern
Architecture
Game
is
the
second
edition
of
the
architecture
game
The
first
edition
was
launched
on
30
August
1999
It
was
the
first
project
collaboration
involving
the
four
partners
at
NEXT
architects
and
was
distributed
in
the
private
environment
of
Delft
University
of
Technology
Ten
years
later
we
ve
produced
a
revised
version
of
the
game
analytically
unravelled
and
improved
This
edition
is
an
international
version
in
the
sense
that
it
is
produced
in
English
but
also
that
the
questions
range
right
across
the
breadth
of
modern
world
history
The
purpose
of
the
game
is
to
reach
the
middle
of
the
board
before
anybody
else
does
This
is
possible
by
answering
all
the
questions
correctly
Give
a
wrong
answer
and
the
infamous
round
glasses
of
Le
Corbusier
are
passed
on
to
the
next
player
The
design
of
the
game
was
paid
special
attention
as
the
game
pins
are
all
inspired
by
famous
modern
buildings
and
the
board
has
a
smooth
black
construction
drawing
Be
sure
to
check

the
game
trailer

you
are

We
recently
received
photos
of
a
fantastic
coffee
table
that
can
be
modified
to
suit
your
needs
The
REK
Coffee
Table
created
by
architect
and
designer
Reinier
de
Jong
transforms
from
a
wooden
block
into
a
multitude
of
designs
with
a
few
simple
moves
After
deigning
furniture
items
like
the
REK
bookcase
KEER
chair
and
VOLT
table
the
talented
Reinier
de
Jong
created
a
versatile
piece
of
furniture
to
accompany
your
everyday
coffee
He
explains
the
inspiration
use
of
materials
and
functions
of
this
modern
coffee
table
REK
is
a
coffee
table
that
grows
with
your
coffee
needs
When
you
have
visitors
just
get
some
chairs
and
extend
the
table
any
way
you
like
Enough
space
for
all
those
coffee
cups
and
store
your
book
or
knitting
set
in
the
spaces
underneath
the
tops
You
can
extend
REK
in
various
ways
Built
in
stops
make
sure
you
will
not
extend
the
sliding
parts
too
far
Of
course
you
can
also
put
REK
in
a
permanent
position
that
fits
your
interior
The
top
and
two
sides
of
REK
are
white
HPL
and
the
edges
are
finished
with
your
choice
of
parquet
wood
oak
berch
or
beech
The
end
grain
side
of
the
wood
is
beveled
in
order
to
get
a
grip
a
subtle
detail
The
dimensions
of
the
REK
table
obviously
vary
with
its
configuration
REK
is
60
by
80
cm
in
collapsed
state
its
maximum
length
is
170
cm
and
its
maximum
width
is
130
cm
REK
coffee
table
is

to

Google
s
Panda
update
was
a
direct
attack
on
bad
content
which
comes
in
many
different
flavours
including
duplicate
weak
thin
and
template
Panda
acts
like
a
domain
wide
penalty
so
your
whole
site
is
affected
and
your
good
pages
are
dragged
down
by
your
bad
pages
This
is
a
guide
on
how
to
find
and
fix
Google
s
Panda
algorithm
update
based
on
our
Panda
fighting
experience
at
SEOgadget
in
2011
Panda
basics
Panda
is
about
dealing
with
bad
content
not
bad
links
Bad
content
comes
in
different
flavours
duplicate
weak
thin
and
template
Panda
acts
like
a
domain
wide
penalty
your
whole
site
is
affected
and
your
good
stuff
is
dragged
down
by
your
bad
stuff
Web
crawler
accessibility
issues
affect
how
search
engines
see
and
therefore
assess
your
content
Often
badly
designed
Information
Architectures
compound
the
problems
with
already
week
content
Large
sites
that
have
many
pages
templated
content
and
lots
of
sub
categories
are
the
most
at
risk
If
you
haven
t
been
monitoring
and
fixing
your
accessibility
issues
as
highlighted
in
Google
Webmaster
Tools
you
are
at
risk
Panda
examples
All
of
these
examples
are
from
the
UK
mostly
from
the
employment
and
gift
sectors
Classic
Panda
We
use
Searchmetric
s
SEO
visibility
score
to
find
out
just
when
sites
got
hit
or
recovered
from
Panda
There
are
three
dates
that
stick
out
in
the
UK
data
Early
April
was
the
big
UK
introduction
of
Panda
There
is
a
smaller
inflection
in
July
There
is
a
bigger
inflection
in
October
Proof
that
doing
nothing
will
not
help
you
You
can
see
in
this
graph
that
they
are
trying
to
fix
their
Panda
issues
but
haven
t
yet
bitten
the
bullet
and
made
the
leap
they
need
to
I
know
these
guys
well
They
have
no
idea
this
data
exists
or
anything
about
panda
but
they
have
done
OK
One
might
argue
that
they
are
OK
because
they
couldn
t
care
less
about
SEO
and
have
a
product
that
people
like
It
would
be
easy
to
attribute
this
to
Panda
but
this
looks
more
like
developer
or
general
website
issues
One
of
my
favourites
from
the
Employment
industry
which
clearly
shows
winners
and
losers
I
love
the
green
line
Did
they
even
know
they
had
benefited
from
Google
Panda
Did
they
think
they
had
done
something
to
deserve
the
new
traffic
Was
it
all
Champagne
cocaine
and
cash
bonuses
and
then
three
months
later
the
next
panda
update
smacks
them
With
Panda
thinning
out
sites
in
a
vertical
it
creates
a
false
sense
of
success
for
the
winners
as
they
themselves
may
be
next
in
line
for
the
chopping
block
The
blue
line
benefits
from
the
first
Panda
update
and
then
it
looks
like
they
get
hit
by
Panda
a
few
months
later
but
I
don
t
think
that
s
Panda
I
think
that
s
development
gone
wrong
Panda
smacks
and
recovery
are
one
day
to
the
next
not
across
a
number
of
weeks
The
other
effect
of
Panda
the
big
brands
got
bigger
Given
this
graph
where
would
you
go
to
look
for
examples
of
sites
that
are
being
rewarded
by
Google
Panda
Find
the
websites
that
benefitted
from
Panda
and
look
at
their
content
as
that
is
now
the
new
minimum
level
of
content
quality
in
your
industry
Panda
recovery
This
data
is
for
Prezzybox
who
we
worked
with
Panda
recovery
is
possible
but
a
lot
of
unplanned
un
budgeted
blood
sweat
tears
and
money
went
into
that
dip
and
recovering
the
traffic
The
SEO
visibility
metric
is
a
proprietary
metric
but
I
asked
Steve
Overton
from
Searchmetrics
if
he
could
give
us
some
more
insight
into
it
and
he
has
explained
the
algorithm
behind
it
Observations
from
fighting
Panda
Panda
is
confusing
if
you
are
not
on
top
of
your
data
and
industry
news
There
were
so
many
updates
it
becomes
easy
to
blame
everything
bad
on
Panda
Conversely
there
are
sites
which
benefitted
from
Panda
but
did
not
attribute
it
When
we
started
exploring
how
to
fix
Panda
we
moved
quite
conservatively
Now
we
suggest
that
people
take
strong
decisive
action
in
resolving
issues
Google
Panda
doesn
t
fix
itself
you
have
to
fix
it
It
will
take
time
money
and
effort
It
also
requires
a
change
in
how
you
see
your
online
business
You
can
make
this
whole
process
a
lot
easier
on
your
business
if
you
put
a
person
in
charge
of
content
and
give
them
a
budget
and
developer
time
The
advice
is
quite
simple
concentrated
around
a
few
key
areas
The
implementation
is
where
companies
fall
down
Fixing
Panda
is
not
complex
but
it
does
require
a
lot
of
work
How
to
fix
Panda
Duplicate
content
Give
someone
the
responsibility
to
hunt
down
duplicate
content
Use
Google
Webmaster
tools
or
SEOmoz
tools
or
Xenu
or
an
IIS
crawl
or
whatever
people
suggest
in
the
blog
comments
It
s
not
tough
to
do
it
just
requires
some
concentrated
effort
Solve
duplicate
content
issues
with
rel
canonical
Here
are
seven
short
videos
of
Google
s
Matt
Cutts
talking
about
different
aspects
of
implementing
rel
canonical
Thin
content
If
you
have
a
section
that
is
just
thin
templated
content
it
is
hurting
the
good
contents
ability
to
rank
Be
strong
and
cut
the
crap
or
add
to
your
content
to
improve
it
Cutting
the
crap
404
a
bad
section
or
area
and
after
the
pages
have
dropped
out
of
the
index
301
them
somewhere
good
so
you
don
t
lose
any
incoming
link
juice
This
is
potentially
the
biggest
win
SEOmoz
has
a
good
guide
to
301s
including
links
to
references
for
301s
under
Apache
and
IIS
Making
your
content
great
There
is
no
getting
around
the
fact
that
time
and
effort
is
needed
here
Someone
in
your
organisation
needs
the
time
and
responsibility
to
sit
down
and
create
great
content
or
manage
the
creation
process
via
third
party
writers
I
believe
that
great
content
requires
both
qualitative
and
quantitative
research
and
a
knowledgably
person
to
knit
it
together
to
suit
both
users
and
search
engines
Here
is
my
guide
on
taking
mediocre
content
and
making
it
great
content
and
an
overview
from
our
work
on
Panda
on
how
Google
might
interpret
content
quality
signals
Templated
content
Write
content
hire
interns
or
find
people
in
cheaper
parts
of
the
world
Many
companies
are
unnecessarily
precious
about
their
content
and
ultimately
this
ends
up
hurting
more
than
helping
them
Elance
Odesk
and
Copify
all
work
for
building
out
content
Remember
you
now
have
a
person
responsible
for
content
quality
who
will
oversee
this
Accessibility
issues
Run
an
IIS
crawl
to
find
your
accessibility
issues
IIS
is
easier
to
use
than
you
think
Here
is
an
example
list
of
errors
from
an
IIS
crawl
This
becomes
your
plan
of
attack
for
clearing
up
accessibility
issues
You
will
end
up
with
a
list
of
issues
and
the
urls
where
those
issues
are
occurring
to
be
able
to
go
and
fix
them
Three
key
takeaways
The
world
is
not
as
it
once
was
Crap
websites
trying
to
masquerade
as
decent
websites
are
being
hunted
down
and
sunk
below
the
quality
line
Google
owes
you
nothing
Tactics
to
just
barely
raise
your
quality
enough
to
recover
your
rankings
are
unlikely
to
pay
dividends
You
may
well
find
yourself
a
loser
again
the
next
time
the
quality
bar
is
raised
Google
is
judging
you
Google
is
going
to
continue
to
raise
the
quality
bar
with
future
updates
When
your
competitors
improve
their
websites
you
will
be
weakest
and
in
line
for
the
chop
at
the
next
quality
update
I
hope
this
post
helps
you
decide
to
build
great
content
today
so
you
dont
have
to
deal
with
the
fallout
from
bad
content
tomorrow

I
d
caution
against
hiring
an
intern

a
foreign
writer
to
handle
your

It
may
be
cheap

you
get
what

You
may
be
right
that
Many
companies
are
unnecessarily
precious
about
their
content
but
I
m
not
sure
that
s
the
real
problem
I
d
say
that
they
re
precious
about
the
wrong
things
Companies
should
be
precious
demanding
insistent
on
really
good
content
But
that
s
content
that
s
absolutely
right
for
their
customer
It
s
not
stuff
that
makes
the
board
feel
good

I
agree
you

to

there
should
be
someone
on

Aaron
Wall
recently
reported
on
a
Google
employee
who
left
comments
on
Hacker
News
to
the
effect
that
SEO
is
bad
for
the
internet
The
Google
employee
Googley
Jon
Rockway
said
that
SEO
isn
t
good
for
users
or
the
internet
at
large
It
s
a
surprising
statement
for
a
Google
employee
to
make
and
I
ve
been
asking
some
SEO
experts
about
their
views
on
the
issue
and
whether
this
reflects
the
search
giant
s
real
views
Here
s
Rockway
s
quote
in
more
detail
Instead
of
being
able
to
SEO
the
entire
Internet
businesses
can
now
only
affect
the
search
results
for
a
tiny
percentage
of
users
That
s
a
good
thing
because
SEO
can
t
scale
and
SEO
isn
t
good
for
users
or
the
Internet
at
large
If
you
look
at
the
Google
experience
from
the
standpoint
of
customers
it
s
pretty
good
Users
get
relevant
search
results
and
ads
Advertisers
get
their
content
on
top
of
everything
else
It
s
a
good
compromise
between
advertising
and
usability
and
it
works
really
well
It
s
a
bug
that
you
could
rank
highly
in
Google
without
buying
ads
and
Google
is
trying
to
fix
the
bug
Manipulating
Google
results
shouldn
t
be
something
you
feel
entitled
to
be
able
to
do
If
you
want
to
rank
highly
in
Google
be
relevant
for
the
user
currently
searching
Engage
him
in
social
media
or
email
provide
relevant
information
about
what
you
re
selling
and
generally
be
a
good
match
for
what
the
user
wants
What
is
the
thinking
behind
this
statement
Search
consultant
Rishi
Lakhani
feels
that
Rockway
has
gaffed
by
revealing
what
could
be
a
very
much
internal
sentiment
by
Google
on
their
stance
on
free
traffic
It
kind
of
reminds
me
of
an
old
SEO
joke
What
is
the
Meaning
of
SPAM
Search
Positions
Above
Mine
However
in
Google
s
possible
view
SPAM
could
mean
Search
Positions
Avoid
Moneymaking
Essentially
what
is
Google
s
money
making
model
Selling
Ads
Every
bit
of
free
traffic
that
a
site
receives
from
organic
search
is
a
loss
in
revenue
to
Google
So
are
you
surprised
at
this
stance
I
am
not
How
is
SEO
bad
for
internet
users
Andrew
Girdwood
Bigmouthmedia
I
have
a
lot
of
sympathy
for
Rockway
s
comment
SEO
that
attempts
to
manipulate
Google
s
or
Bing
s
search
results
so
that
less
relevant
results
are
returned
above
more
relevant
results
is
not
good
for
users
or
the
internet
I
don
t
believe
there
is
a
single
SEO
any
more
Some
of
the
SEO
throwbacks
and
perhaps
some
of
the
new
strands
do
fall
into
the
not
helpful
category
Spam
for
example
is
not
helpful
The
benefits
of
SEO
for
web
users
Yes
there
are
plenty
of
spammers
out
there
but
good
SEO
has
benefits
for
businesses
and
web
users
Here
are
just
a
few
of
those
It
has
encouraged
greater
usability
As
Site
Visibility
s
Kelvin
Newman
points
out
many
improvements
to
website
usability
have
been
made
in
order
to
optimise
for
search
engines
There
s
lots
of
annoying
aspects
of
websites
that
SEO
has
had
a
role
killing
off
I
think
the
good
Karma
for
SEO
ending
the
trend
of
splash
pages
is
enough
to
see
the
industry
through
a
decade
of
bad
behaviour
Elizabeth
Ayers
from
iCrossing
echoes
this
sentiment
If
large
quality
brands
did
not
optimise
their
sites
for
search
then
it
is
likely
that
the
web
would
be
a
poorer
place
The
web
and
social
would
not
be
as
advanced
as
it
is
today
if
SEO
hadn
t
been
such
a
key
revenue
driver
for
brands
to
take
advantage
of
and
participate
in
creating
quality
content
and
participating
on
social
platforms
It
encourages
business
to
create
better
content
Content
is
key
to
great
SEO
and
cheap
tactics
like
keyword
stuffing
just
don
t
cut
it
any
more
Instead
creating
content
that
people
want
to
read
and
share
is
what
works
best
Andrew
Girdwood
Modern
SEO
is
helpful
It
is
less
an
advertising
tactic
and
more
a
marketing
strategy
Modern
SEO
involves
creating
and
working
with
engaging
content
content
so
good
that
users
want
to
share
and
discuss
it
This
is
a
boon
for
users
and
the
net
as
it
creates
an
upwards
pressure
on
quality
It
makes
businesses
more
relevant
to
users
Rishi
Lakhani
Competitive
SEO
actually
helps
make
businesses
even
more
relevant
to
searchers
Because
we
know
who
links
naturally
and
why
A
page
full
of
carburettors
for
sale
may
not
get
links
what
is
the
motivation
But
a
page
that
shows
how
to
clean
your
carburettor
will
The
difference
between
intent
and
motivation
differs
and
it
s
the
SEO
community
that
is
hard
at
work
encouraging
such
content
SEO
is
not
bad
for
the
user
but
for
Google
s
pockets
SEO
can
help
small
businesses
to
punch
above
their
weight
There
are
businesses
spending
big
bucks
on
SEO
and
paid
search
but
by
using
solid
SEO
techniques
creating
a
usable
site
and
filling
it
with
great
content
small
businesses
can
rank
higher
than
bigger
rivals
Social
CRM
Andrew
Girdwood
A
strong
example
of
how
Modern
SEO
is
great
for
users
in
general
is
in
the
emergence
of
social
CRM
Businesses
are
increasing
their
efforts
to
look
after
customers
online
using
platforms
like
Twitter
and
Google
to
reach
out
to
people
who
have
had
a
bad
experience
with
a
brand
or
encountered
some
other
problem
This
is
in
part
due
to
the
rise
of
social
but
this
is
also
an
example
of
Modern
SEO
Google
blogged
back
in
2010
that
being
bad
to
your
customers
is
bad
for
business
Customers
benefit
whenever
brands
take
extra
effort
to
look
after
them
and
the
convergence
of
search
and
social
have
given
business
extra
incentive
to
do
just
that
Is
SEO
bad
for
Google
Is
this
the
real
subtext
of
this
statement
gaff
or
not
As
Rockway
says
thanks
to
recent
changes
such
as
Search
Plus
the
amount
of
Google
homepage
real
estate
which
is
open
to
influence
by
SEO
is
shrinking
So
is
Google
seeking
to
minimise
the
role
of
the
SEO
Rishi
Lakhani
feels
strongly
about
this
Of
course
there
are
bad
approaches
to
SEO
However
this
attitude
that
SEO
SPAM
should
stop
Because
the
biggest
violators
are
Google
themselves
It
takes
content
from
third
party
sites
and
slowly
wraps
it
up
with
ads
Google
gets
into
short
term
partnerships
with
businesses
with
an
edge
learn
their
processes
use
those
to
build
up
their
own
offering
and
then
terminate
those
relationships
Up
to
a
few
years
ago
Google
used
to
use
Yell
to
supply
local
content
Now
it
s
overtaken
by
Google
Local
For
years
Google
has
been
taking
money
from
credit
card
companies
and
comparison
sites
alike
Now
it
has
launched
its
own
version
which
it
uses
Adwords
to
push

Great
article
that
poses
a
good
question
As
an
SEO
I
get
this
question
quite
often
The
article
really
touched
on
some
good
points
One
in
particular
in
that
SEO
is
not
bad
for
the
internet
but
actually
is
good
in
that
it
improves
usability
of
the

Optimisation
of
social
based
algorithms
such
as
Edgerank
have
consequences
even
worse
than
what
SEO
s
have
added
or
taken
away
from
search
based
algorithm
optimisations
Social
networks
rely
on
recommendation
algorithms
that
can
be
gamed
The
worst
part
of
a
social
recommendation
algorithm
is
the
potential
to
create
an
eventual
bubble
affect
where
users
become
hugely
small
minded
and
less
about
doing
more
knowing
more
and
ceasing
to
ask
why
more
To
know
more

the
bubble

This
hits
it
on
the
nail
for
me
Every
bit
of
free
traffic
that
a
site
receives
from
organic
search
is
a
loss
in
revenue
to
Google
There
seems
to
have
been
a
very
different
stance
to
running
Google
with
Larry
Page
as
CEO
which
I
m
not
convinced
will
endear
users
to
Google
The
don
t
be
evil
tool
is
a
great
example
of
how
Google
have
changed
as
a
company
as
the
tool
states
the
relevancy
of
results
is
still
as
good
as
ever
however
there
s
a
different
commercial
agenda
at
Google
now
Google
are
entitled
to
run
Google
how
they
think
it
should
be
run
but
with
any
long
standing
brand
the
core
values
are
built
up
through
trust
and
awareness
over
time
Trust
is
being
eroded
away
and
what
was
once
a
fairly
clear
set
of
core
values
seems
murky
It
does
sound
like
internal
sentiment
as
to
what
Google
thinks
of
SEO
but
good
SEO
improves
the
quality
of
what
Google
returns
Its
a
WIN
WIN
for
both
Google
and
SEOs
one
cannot
work
without
the
other
especially
since
the
Google
signals
rely
on
proper
website
structure
which
the
majority
of
SEOs
have
helped
develop
over
the
last
decade
This
article
still
rings
true
for
the
2
areas
where
google
may
slip
up
quality
of
results
and
overdoing
the
social
drive

If
you
want
to
rank
highly
in
Google
be
relevant
for
the
user
currently
searching
Erm
that
s
called
SEO
Granted
there
are
many
flavours
of
SEO
some
more
oily
than
others
but
for
many
organisations
SEO
is
an
essential
part
of
running
a
business
online
The
goals
of
SEO
should
simply
be
to
improve
editorial
and
technical
quality
not
to
mention
competitiveness
which
results
in
a
better
UX
all
round
Without
SEOs
who
helps
raise
the
editorial
bar
many
journalists
still
neglect
copy
that
they
believe
is
invisible
who
ensures
that
slavishly
produced
content
is
optimised
to
the
people
that
are
looking
for
it
most
who
checks
for
damaging
site
errors
very
often
people
who
should
have
clocked
them
have
not
who
ensures
pages
are
coded
to
proper
standards
so
that
they
are
discoverable
in
search
While
you
could
nominate
other
company
roles
to
all
of
the
above
truth
is
most
of
the
time
they
re
just
cleaning
up
someone
else
s
mess
So
really
SEO
done
the
right
way
is
about
improving
the
web
not
ruining
it

Hi
Graham
I
think
this
is
a
timely
article
SEO
is
not
inherently
bad
diluting
quality
is
Some
of
what
Rockway
said
is
bang
on
the
money
if
you
want
to
rank
highly
in
Google
be
relevant
for
the
user
currently
searching
However
he
positions
his
opinion
poorly
Positive
SEO
is
about
being
relevant
if
you
re
not
relevant
you
ll
just
get
poor
metrics
and
people
won
t
come
back
I
think
Rishi
s
last
comment
is
quite
interesting
Google
taking
3rd
party
content
and
wrapping
it
with
ads
It
s
all
about
the
money
to
them
I
don
t
believe
anymore
that
the
focus
is
on
the
user
The
focus
is
on
driving
revenue
and
they
have
to
think
about
the
user
to
achieve
that
SEO
is
an
innate
thing
it
can
t
be
bad
it
s
the
people
behind
it
that
are
choosing
whether
or
not
to
follow
good
or
bad
practice
So
let
s
focus
praise
and
criticism
on
the
people
doing
not
a
marketing
discipline
thanks

how

that

encouraging

helping
a

the

be
a

this

the

along

and
delberate

of

that
do

I
feel
this
Googler
slipped
up
on
his
choice
of
wording
about
SEO
His
opinion
harks
back
to
the
stigma
associated
with
SEO
of
5
years
ago
back
then
SEO
was
regarded
as
trying
to
outsmart
Google
by
looking
for
loopholes
People
did
exploit
these
methods
until
they
were
closed
off
but
sites
that
were
ranking
falsely
genuinely
didn
t
add
to
the
user
experience
Many
of
these
websites
were
affiliate
sites
or
sites
littered
with
adverts
SEO
s
should
be
working
toward
consumer
centric
SEO
This
means
only
optimising
websites
in
ways
that
will
enhance
the
user
s
experience
They
can
do
using
content
rich
campaigns
and
techniques
that
help
users
find
useful
information
easily
White
hat
SEO
s
should
be
working
in
the
best
interest
of
everyone
the
user
the
site
owner
AND
the
search
engines
Google
is
embracing
SEO
regardless
of
what
this
employee
says
e
g
Google
s
Search
Engine
Optimization
Starter
Guide
Developments
in
webmaster
tools
also
encourage
site
owners
to
make
changes
to
their
website
so
that
Google
can
crawl
it
more
efficiently
and
help
it
understand
what
their
site
is
about
SEO
s
should
be
working
to
help
Google
in
its
plight
for
high
quality
relevant
search
results
not
fighting
against
it
to
warp
the
results
for
profit
While
we
disagree
that
SEO
is
bad
for
the
internet
we
do
agree
however
that
black
hat
SEO
is
bad
for
the
user
and
everyone
in
the
long
run
A
good
post
and
interesting
discussion

Google
are
clearly

decreasing

real

There
are
now
Google

results
more
social

according
to
our

99

have

If
there
was
no
SEO
good
sites
would
naturally
rise
to
the
top
of
the
rankings
because
people
would
link
to
them
SEOs
running
link
building
campaigns
skew
this
data
by
creating
hundreds
of
links
to
content
which
people
would
otherwise
not
be
interested
in
reading
Some
SEOs
resort
to
posting
links
on
unprotected
forums
and
comment
threads
Harm
clearly
is
done
in

Nicholas
if
you
have
search
engines
you
have
SEO
The
two
are
inseparable
The
search
engines
have
to
decide
a
method
by
which
sites
are
ranked
highest
and
website
owners
and
marketers
want
to
figure
out
how
and
improve
their
own
rankings
With
modern
SEO
as
Andrew
Girdwood
calls
it
you
have
more
user
friendly
websites
which
have
to
create
content
that
is
interesting
and
relevant
to
the
searcher
This
benefits

I
think
this
is
a
bit
of
a
red
herring
In
general
SEO
has
always
benefited
Google
they
ve
simply
tried
to
blacken
the
areas
that
risked
devaluing
their
algorithm
At
the
moment
they
re
in
the
middle
of
tweaking
the
rules
considerably
so
that
SEO
benefits
them
even
further
As
one
example
they
re
dangling
the
carrot
of
more
traffic
for
website
owners
to
buy
into
the
Google
SPYW
stuff
In
doing
so
they
hope
this
will
help
to
drag
the
mainstream
across
And
of
course
if
that
all
works
out
they
win
twice
once
for
the
social
network
element
of
Google
once
for
embedding
themselves
as
a
large
downstream
recipient

This
is
a
curious
debate
thread
although
I
agree
with
Rishi
s
reasoning
Google
Apple
Microsoft
are
run
by
shareholders
and
accountants
Data
is
a
valuable
resource
and
to
expect
a
private
company
to
actively
support
ventures
that
threaten
income
streams
may
be
a
little
short
sighted
Facebook
backed
by
Goldman
Sachs
is
floating
soon
is
it
any
wonder
that
Google
is
looking
at
giving
less
away
and
developing
and
tightening
up
its
core
business
restrictions
of
keyword
data
normalisation
of
personal
records
across
accounts
google
In
a
few
years
time
its
possible
that
people
will
look
back
at
this
period
and
be
amazed
that
you
could
get
free
traffic
free
data
and
build
successful
businesses
without
investing
all
that
heavily

Yeah
Google
thinks
it
s
bad
cause
they
don
t
earn
money
from
good
natural
SEO
A
search
engine
without
natural
results
is
probably
their
ideal
I
imagine
the
Yellow
Pages
came
up
with
an
idea
pre
internet
to
charge
consumers
for
their
directories
as
well
as
businesses

This
is
ridiculous
For
someone
to
say
that
Optimising
a
website
for
a
Search
Engine
is
bad
for
the
internet
would
logically
imply
that
there
s
something
wrong
with
the

itself

I
presume
he
s
referring
to
old
style
SEO
where
links
are
bought
or
other
shady
practices
are
used
to
push
rankings
artificially
high
That
is
bad
for
users
But
Authentic
Search
where
quality
content
is
provided
on
site
to
match
what
users
are
looking
for
and
promoted
off
site
through
quality
free
editorial
is
clearly
very
good
for
users

How
about
this
for
discussion
Realistically
we
should
in
the
long
term
consider
any
traffic
received
from
Google
for
free
as
a
gift
and
plan
for
what
is
no
doubt
coming
down
the
line
if
you
make
money
from
Google
traffic
expect
them
to
take
a
cut
unless
you
have
done
something
remarkable
to
earn
it
Were
we
talking
about
physical
property
the
discussion
would
be
very
different
Were
Google
a
shopping
centre
with
a
90
share
of
footfall
we
d
laugh
at
the
idea
of
letting
traders
set
up
stalls
and
sell
for
free
whilst
at
the
same
time
charging
other
tenants
for
their
space
We
d
think
it
hilarious
that
we
could
use
sometimes
dubious
techniques
to
corral
shoppers
to
our
stand
perhaps
we
d
put
up
barriers
and
PVC
banners
outside
a
paying
tenant
s
shop
diverting
people
Can
you
imagine
Looking
for
a
Cheap
Mobile
Phone
Come
to
our
cheap
mobile
phone
stand
for
cheap
mobile
deals
etc
etc
We
d
be
bent
over
double
at
the
entreaties
from
retailers
who
consider
themselves
ethical
and
who
claim
to
provide
what
customers
are
looking
for
yet
want
to
make
a
profit
for
themselves
without
paying
rent
to
the
shopping
centre
regardless
of
the
information
they
provide
to
users
at
the
stand
or
the
special
free
guides
Getting
the
most
from
your
organic
eggs
naturally
written
by
an
organic
egg
guru
they
give
away
to
everyone
willing
to
hand
over
their
mobile
phone
number
or
email
address
Yet
this
is
the
freedom
we
all
expect
from

This
post
highlights
a
simple
useful
feature
that
s
crept
onto
most
of
the
UK
s
largest
e
commerce
sites
over
the
last
couple
of
years
with
no
real
coverage
The
promo
strip
is
not
new
but
has
slowly
caught
on
to
the
point
it
s
almost
standard
for
high
street
retailers
yet
still
fairly
rare
on
smaller
sites
It
s
a
very
useful
addition
from
both
the
customer
perspective
quickly
informative
without
being
overbearing
and
from
the
brand
perspective
conversion
orientated
without
being
overbearing
There
are
12
examples
below
including
variations
on
the
central
idea
The
Promo
Strip
Here
s
an
example
of
the
most
basic
version
from
Play
com
That
s
it
A
simple
strip
of
key
information
that
appears
under
the
top
navigation
of
a

Interesting
variations
on

theme
Other
than

here
are
a
few
variations
from
retailers
who
ve
gone
a
little
further
Marks

M
S
step
things
up
nicely
from
their
competitors
showing
international
and
UK
delivery
info
but
also
highlighting
current
promotions
in
an
area
every
site
visitor
will
see
M
S
almost
always
has
sales
on
some
areas
of
the
site
and
this
allows
the
retailer
to
flag
these
to
everyone
who
lands
on
the
site
Boux
Avenue
Another
retailer
showing
their
delivery
and
returns
info
but
Boux
Avenue
is
worth
a
mention
as
whereas
other
retailers
have
lumped
the
promo
strip
on
top
of
their
existing
design
Boux
have
folded
it
very
neatly
in
with
the
overall
look
theme
of
the
site
Naked
Wines
Naked
s
version
differs
slightly
from
others
Firstly
it
s
above
the
navigation
Secondly
it
introduces
some
urgency
and
a
deadline
with
their
Order
in
the
next
XX

Penhaligon
s
Penhaligon
s
fill
this
area
of

space
in
its
layout
with
free

info
but
also
very
usefully
for
a
heavily
gifted
brand
promotes
its
free
gift
wrapping
service
here
Pen
Heaven
As
with
Naked
Wines
Pen
Heaven
again
focuses
on
urgency
offering
same
day
engraving
for
orders
before
a
particular
time
It
also
features
customer
reviews
heavily
here
great
for
a
smaller
brand
that
visitors
may
not
have
heard
of
Kiddicare
Kiddicare
is
probably
the
UK
s
leading
baby
product
website
it
also
leads
the
way
here
with
its
promo
strip
First
it
beats
out
all
of
the
standard
delivery
promos
with
next
day
delivery
in
1
hour
slots
Second
it
shows
off
the
365
day
return
policy
Third
Kiddicare
offers
a
price
match
promise
Taking
it
far
further
the
retailer
has
added
these
strips
down
either
side
of
the
main
content
These
strips
are
hidden
if
you
re
on
a
smaller
resolution
eg
1024x768
For
anyone
on
a
larger
monitor
they
reinforce
the
price
match
fast
despatch
but
also
show
off
their
many
awards
and
promote
their
119
000
product
reviews
Summary
As
you
can
see
these
have
popped
up
all
over
the
place
They
re
a
very
simple
addition
to
highlight
features
or
info
you
want
to
show
off
to
all
of
your
visitors
If
you
run
an
e
commerce
site
and
haven
t
already
tried
this
it
s
worth
testing
If
you
re
already
running
this
with
the
bog
standard
free
delivery
over
xx
it
s
worth
trialing
some
other
ideas
to
see
the
impact
they
have
There
are
some
nice
extensions
to
this
too
personalising
them
to
include
discount
codes
depending
on
traffic
source
etc
If
you
re
willing
to
A
B
test
it
it
s
probably
worth
paying
more
attention
to
the
impact
it
has
on
new
visitors
or
first
time
buyers
rather
than
your
overall
conversion
rate

Great
article
Dan
highlighting
something
which
I
have
been
talking
about
and
presenting
ideas
on
over
the
last
12
months
The
promo
strip
is
a
great
example
of
a
design
pattern
which
I
am
seeing
users
actively
engage
with
during
user
testing
sessions
Your
summary
of
the
benefits
of
this
feature
is
spot
on
too
It
s
a
very
useful
addition
from
both
the
customer
perspective
quickly
informative
without
being
overbearing
and
from
the
brand
perspective
conversion
orientated
without
being
overbearing
Picking
up
on
the
Naked
Wines
example
you
have
provided
they
have
in
fact
featured
this
countdown
timer
since
they
launched
their
site
and
its
a
superb
way
to
deliver
a
persuasive
technique
creating
a
sense
of
urgency
to
which
you
can
almost
guarantee
all
site
visitors
will
see
even
if
only
sub
consciously
A
quick
recommendation
I
make
to
retailers
when
they
are
implementing
these
strips
is
to
not
try
cramming
too
many
messages
in
the
space
If
you
compare
John
Lewis
to
Pen
Heaven
or
Kiddicare
it
takes
less
effort
to
scan
the
latter
two
sites
messages
along
with
them
using
visual
elements
to
help
differentiate
the
messages

Thanks
Paul
And
great
advice
Interestingly
I
don
t
think
the
Naked
Wines
design
had
it
from
the
start
I
could
be
wrong
but
I
think
this
was
their
original
http
bit
ly
originalnw
I
think
that
makes
a
nice
point
too
it
s
really
useful
to
test
this
kind
of
thing
to
find
out
what
works
for
your
site
your
audience
and
your
business
needs

Agree
on
your
point
that
its
been
quietly
bubbling
away
on
many
e
com
sites
without
too
much
focus
Very
useful
when
used
in
the
right
way
One
thing
I
ve
not
seen
is
contextualising
and
personalising
this
area
there
are
pros
and
cons
associated
with
this
but
used
correctly
you
could
use
profile
data
on
the
user
ie
first
visit
categories
browsed
etc
to
provide
some
persuasive
prompting
e
g
for
a
first
time
visitor
provide
generic
deliver
returns
click
collect
etc
info
and
start
tailoring
the
message
as
a
visitor
moves
from
first
time
to
a
potential
customer
to
becoming
a
customer
etc
and
then
within
things
that
fit
your
brand
such
as
male
female
like
the
M
S
example
simply
choosing
whether
to
display
the
Men
s
or
Women
s
Trouser
Offer

They
are
fantastic
examples
of
persuading
the
user
without
bombarding
them
with
too
much
information
I
couldn
t
agree
more
with
Paul
about
the
scanning
the
messages
How
adding
a
bit
of
colour
to
break
the
different
messages
down
alongside
more
leading
text
Another
great
example
of
this
is
ASOS
they
really
are
fantastic
and
persuading

out

Interesting
to
see
so
many
retailers
using
the
bar
to
promote
their
delivery
offerings
Perhaps
it
s
because
most
of
their
customers
are
familiar
with
their
wider
propositions
so
they
don
t
need
to
push
the
why
choose
us
message
I
d
advocate
using
the
bar
to
push
the
key
USPs
for
the
business
particularly
for
smaller
less
well
known
retailers
fighting
to
make
their
mark
It
would
be
interesting
to
see
eye
tracking
studies
or
survey
people
using
sites
featuring
promo
bars
to
see
if
the
content
registers
with
them
or
not
Given
that
the
bar
is
likely
to
be
in
their
eyeline
as
they
journey
through
the
site
I
d
wager
that
it
registers
subconsciously
even
if
they
dont
actively
read
it

Very
interesting
indeed
Thanks
Dan
I
think
it
s
very
good
when
patterns
like
these
start
to
emerge
As
with
top
navigation
and
side
navigation
or
email
address
then
password
for
login
as
an
even
more
common
one
it
helps
if
new
visitors
have
some
expectation
of
where
some
things
may
be
I
agree
with
Albie
that
the
why
choose
us
message
is
very
important
too
Not
one
of
these
examples
does
much
along
those
lines
I
think
they
re
assuming
everyone
will
recognise
them
which
is
no
longer
a
safe
bet
But
in
fact
I
think
a
USP
message
need
to
be
bigger
and
more
prominent
than
these
strips
One
question
for
Paul
you
mention
people
engaging
with
these
strips
in
usability
tests
Was
that
just
mentioning
them
in
think
out
loud
or
actually
clicking
please
I
m
reassured
either
way
because
all
too
often
I
find
people
manage
to
miss
even
prominent
messages
But
I
m
also
slightly
concerned
if
someone
s
first
reaction
when
landing
on
a
site
was
to
click
for
details
on
something
like
this
even
if
it
does
demonstrate
a
keen
commercial
intent

In
most
instances
it
was
displayed
on
the
main
page
and
as
the
writer
pointed
out
it
can
appear
on
all
pages
I
believe
it
could
be
very
useful
as
it
is
an
upsell
on
the
checkout
page
opinion
It
distracts
from
the
natural
flow
of
the
menu
and
home
page
flow
and
would
cause
most
consumers
to
pause
just
long
enough
to
wonder
why
they
are
there
and
leave
A
more
interesting
study
Albie
would
be
a
correlation
between
eye
tracking
and
conversion
rates
as
while
I
certainly
agree
it
s
a
great
idea
it
s
the
type
of
distraction
that
can
potentially
loose
a
customer
if
over
used
It
would
be
unusual
that
something
like
this
would
have
been
incorporated
into
the
original
design
of
the
site
and
as
such
adding
it
afterwords
without
breaking
up
the
natural
flow
of
the
original
design
would
be
difficult
I
think
it
s
an
excellent
way
to
drawer
additional
value
to
your
site
but
only
if
used
in
moderation
and
where
a
customer
might
naturally
expect
to
see
it
Very
nice
article

I
ve
done
some
research
around
this
area
and
have
started
to
call
them
confidence
banners
since
they
often
don
t
aim
to
directly
convert
with
a
call
to

merely
instill
confidence
in

Domino
s
Pizza
UK
Ireland
has
revealed
that
13
of
its
digital
sales
come
through
a
tablet
or
smartphone
These
stats
were
released
today
as
the
company
also
launched
a
Windows
7
version
of
its
mobile
app
the
seventh
channel
that
s
now
available
for
mobile
sales
Mobile
has
proved
to
be
a
hugely
successful
avenue
for
Domino
s
the
company
s
iPhone
app
alone
has
generated
over
10m
in
sales
in
the
past
year
and
now
accounts
for
4
1
of
all
online
orders
Domino
s
head
of
commercial
systems
Paul
Francis
says
that
the
brand
lends
itself
brilliantly
to
mobile
retail
13
of
all
digital
sales
come
though
a
tablet
or
smartphone
so
we
know
that
for
many
customers
mobile
is
the
preferred
way
of
ordering
We
have
ambitious
plans
for
2012
and
I
am
delighted
that
we
can
offer
this
new
app
for
the
Windows
Phone
7
platform
We
look
forward
to
hearing
what
our
customers
think
Whereas
Domino
s
multimedia
manager
Nick
Dutch
highlighted
that
this
new
app
release
built
by
Vexed
Digital
is
a
response
to
developing
consumer
trends
and
staying
ahead
of
the
game
With
WP7
we
see
a
great
opportunity
to
get
into
the
hands
of
loyal
Nokia
fans
who
will
be
upgrading
as
WP7
launches
Back
in
September
we
reviewed
Domino
s
iPad
app
which
to
this
day
provides
a
significant
advantage
for
the
company
over
its
main
rival
Pizza
Hut
which
has
not
done
anything
with
mobile
at
all
in
the
UK
at
least
Like
the
iPhone
version
the
iPad
app
developed
by
Somo
is
well
designed
and
intuitive
to
use
and
the
larger
screen
allows
it
to
use
high
resolution
images
of
its
pizzas
The
brand
also
released
a
second
app
in
the
app
in
the
US
in
November
Named
Pizza
Hero
it
s
a
game
format
that
times
how
long
it
takes
for
you
to
virtually
top
a
pizza
with
points
awarded
for
performance
Once
you
ve
passed
levels
one
through
five
affectionately
nicknamed
Pizza
School
other
players
will
get
a
chance
to
rate
your
performance
Players
can
then
of
course
order
a
real
delivery
through
the
app
Domino
s
also
announced
today
that
it
was
reviewing
its
digital
and
direct
marketing
account
A
large
proportion
of
Domino
s
marketing
budget
is
spent
on
digital
advertising
with
nearly
half
of
its
pizza
sales
now
made
online

Leading
supermarket
first
to
implement
personalised
retargeting
for
groceries
LONDON
9
FEBRUARY
2012
Criteo
the
global
leader
in
performance
display
advertising
today
announced
that
Waitrose
has
selected
its
industry
leading
solution
for
implementation
on
its
website
Waitrose
com
The
partnership
will
make
Waitrose
the
first
supermarket
in
the
UK
to
use
online
personalised
retargeting
for
groceries
helping
to
drive
consumer
relationships
Visitors
to
Waitrose
com
will
be
presented
with
highly
relevant
products
and
offers
on
selected
media
sites
as
part
of
their
internet
journey
upon
leaving
the
site
This
development
marks
an
important
step
in
Waitrose
s
investment
in
its
ecommerce
platform
over
the
last
year
which
included
the
opening
of
a
dedicated
Dotcom
Fulfilment
Centre
in
West
London
Waitrose
s
commitment
to
its
online
channel
enabled
the
retailer
to
increase
online
sales
by
49
in
the
seven
days
leading
up
to
Christmas
2011
As
the
industry
leader
Criteo
was
an
obvious
choice
for
us
enabling
us
to
present
consumers
with
relevant
and
up
to
date
product
information
in
a
visually
rewarding
way
said
Nick
White
Head
of
Online
Commercial
at
Waitrose
We
are
driving
innovation
in
the
grocery
sector
by
being
the
first
supermarket
to
adopt
personalised
retargeting
enhancing
our
ecommerce
strategy
and
making
online
shopping
even
easier
for
our
customers
We
are
already
seeing
a
tenfold
increase
in
the
click
through
rate
compared
to
non
targeted
display
activity
as
well
as
a
high
level
of
conversions
Criteo
leverages
consumer
intent
in
the
same
way
as
search
advertising
by
showing
ads
for
products
based
on
the
browsing
behaviour
of
people
on
Waitrose
com
Criteo
uses
a
predictive
engine
that
is
able
to
recommend
products
based
on
the
behaviour
of
other
consumers
that
have
viewed
the
same
or
similar
products
The
adverts
are
created
in
real
time
to
ensure
consideration
of
stock
availability
and
pricing
Waitrose
can
easily
track
the
success
throughout
by
comparing
the
cost
of
sale
with
the
click
through
purchase
cost
to
ensure
that
it
remains
viable
and
successful
It
is
great
to
see
an
industry
leader
such
as
Waitrose
driving
innovation
in
the
retail
sector
Michael
Steckler
MD
for
Northern
Europe
at
Criteo
said
We
share
a
common
goal
as
we
continually
aim
to
provide
consumers
with
a
more
relevant
online
shopping
experience
he
added
Developments
are
also
in
progress
to
enable
Waitrose
to
present
consumers
with
items
that
they
have
forgotten
to
place
in
their
online
trolley
prior
to
the
delivery
date
as
well
as
re
advertise
purchased
items
once
they
re
likely
to
have
been
consumed

We
ve
already
asked
industry
experts
about
what
2012
holds
for
search
and
e
commerce
now
it
s
the
turn
of
web
analytics
2011
was
a
busy
year
for
Google
Analytics
updates
as
well
as
the
EU
Privacy
law
and
our
experts
identify
the
issues
to
look
out
for
in
the
next
12
months
What
were
the
most
significant
trends
in
web
analytics
last
year
Brian
Clifton
Founder
of
Advanced
Web
Metrics
com
The
biggest
change
by
far
has
been
the
introduction
of
the
EU
Privacy
Law
that
came
into
effect
on
25th
May
2011
It
wasn
t
a
great
surprise
as
privacy
has
been
bubbling
below
the
surface
of
our
industry
for
the
last
five
years
see
my
post
Five
Predictions
For
Web
Analytics
in
2011
but
how
this
law
has
been
interpreted
did
shock
the
web
analytics
world
at
least
across
Europe
Sadly
the
ICO
the
Independent
Commissioner
s
Office
who
in
the
UK
are
responsible
for
providing
guidance
and
enforce
this
law
has
taken
the
view
that
benign
web
tracking
that
is
anonymous
and
aggregate
visit
data
collected
by
tools
such
as
Google
Analytics
are
not
allowed
to
do
so
without
explicit
consent
of
the
visitor
That
means
you
force
an
ugly
and
intrusive
pop
up
window
or
similar
notice
asking
your
visitors
for
consent
The
ICO
has
done
this
see
the
top
banner
of
their
site
and
seen
a
drop
of
90
in
the
traffic
they
are
able
to
measure
Imagine
the
impact
that
would
have
on
an
e
commerce
site
90
of
your
data
suddenly
lost
Clearly
this
is
wrong
The
focus
needs
to
be
on
the
abusers
of
online
tracking
not
people
following
best
practice
This
will
rumble
on
throughout
2012
for
sure
Matt
Clarke

commerce

mixture
of
really
annoying
things
missing
data
sampled
data
missing
keywords
and
some
really
innovative
things
The
GA
team
has
certainly
been
very
busy
and
it
s
been
hard
to
keep
track
of
the
many
new
additions
they
ve
made
to
the
tool
In
just
12
months
we
ve
seen
the
introduction
of
site
speed
metrics
social
media
metrics
the
brilliant
multi
channel
funnels
improved
dashboards
and
reports
flow
analysis
and
code
improvements
to
event
tracking
and
the

Not
to
mention
Google

Premium

those

The
Google
Analytics
updates
have
been
great
They
ve
updated
more
this
year
than
in
the
last
few
years
combined
I
think
the
move
toward
multi
visit
analysis
is
really
nice
and
that
will
only
continue
Pulling
in
different
types
of
off
site
data
is
also
really
interesting
and
I
d
bet
that
gets
extended
much
further
From
my
point
of
view
a
really
nice
trend
over
the
last
year
is
that
more
of
the
people
I
work
with
have
gone
from
asking
how
do
we
set
up
reports
to
what
can
we
do
with
this
data
My
dad
published
a
Kindle
book
this
year
after
having
realised
there
was
an
audience
for
it
on
the
basis
of
his
Google
Analytics
data
It
s
brilliant
to
see
lots
of
people
actually
using
all
this
amazing
data
that
s
available
What
s
on
the
horizon
for
2012
Matt
Clarke
The
thing
that
s
going
to
be
on
the
mind
of
everyone
who
operates
a
site
in
the
EU
is
the
forthcoming
cookie
legislation
which
is
due
to
be
enforced
from
May
I
m
sure
some
agencies
will
gain
new
business
by
offering
cookie
audits
policies
and
tools
to
obtain
permission
but
I
think
it
remains
to
be
seen
how
many
will
even
bother
to
implement
anything
particularly
initially
I
think
many
are
likely
to
see
what
their
competitors
do
and
look
at
the
methods
being
used
to
obtain
permission
as
those
proposed
so
far
haven
t
been
great
It
would
be
nice
if
this
problem
could
simply
be
passed
back
to
the
browser
developers
but
I
don
t
think
that
s
going
to
happen
The
analytics
tool
vendors
have
also
been
very
quiet
on
the
issue
I
m
hoping
that
it
will
be
possible
that
we
ll
be
able
to
avoid
prosecution
by
taking
fairly
simple
measures
that
don
t
significantly
harm
the
user
experience
Brian
Clifton
I
think
2012
could
be
the
year
that
the
long
standing
issue
of
integrating
offsite
metrics
with
onsite
metrics
comes
of
age
The
big
offsite
metrics
questions
are
what
people
and
how
many
are
saying
about
you
away
from
your
website
i
e
social
media
Because
this
happens
offsite
and
in
many
disparate
systems
networks
its
measurement
and
correlation
with
what
happens
on
your
site
has
so
far
not
been
an
easy
task
to
achieve
Dan
Barker
The
cookie
law
again
mobile
and
social
analytics
will
be
big
topics
next
year
I
think
multichannel
analytics
and
predictive
analytics
will
start
to
go
mainstream
too
and
that
automation
based
on
analytics
data
will
become
a
bit
easier
There
s
an
odd
situation
in
the
web
analytics
market
at
the
moment
in
that
Google
Analytics
now
serves
95
of
sites
The
big
flaw
in
Google
Analytics
is
that
it
doesn
t
let
you
track
personally
identifiable
information
so
you
can
t
use
it
to
answer
even
simple
questions
like
who
were
my
biggest
customers
this
year
what
s
bringing
them
to
the
website
and
how
often
are
they
visiting
To
get
those
answers
you
either
have
to
move
to
a
very
niche
web
analytics
tool
or
pay
mid
high
five
figures
Someone
is
bound
to
fix
that
soon
as
it
s
a
problem
that
exists
for
almost
every
website
and
it
s
weird
that
the
bulk
of
web
analytics
is
so
far
away
from
being
customer
centric
at
the
moment
BI
web
analytics
will
keep
moving
closer
together
and
by
the
end
of
the
year
someone
will
have
used
the
words
big
data
on
Question
Time
and
the
cast
of
TOWIE
will
have
had
a
punch
up
over
the
merits
of
NoSQL
What
s
on
your
wish
list
for
2012
Brian
Clifton
I
hope
that
a
better
understanding
of
privacy
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
solidifies
in
2012
Privacy
is
a
big
issue
for
anyone
online
it
is
simply
too
easy
at
present
for
this
to
be
abused
and
a
couple
of
high
profile
cases
could
really
harm
the
ability
of
website
owners
to
collect
the
benign
stuff
Bad
practice
has
to
go
so
in
general
the
new
EU
Privacy
Law
is
a
good
thing
Bad
practice
includes
the
surreptitious
collection
of
personal
identifiable
information
sharing
of
visit
information
with
3rd
parties
i
e
3rd
party
cookies
and
similar
techniques
and
the
tracking
of
visits
between
different
unrelated
websites
sorry
DoubleClick
I
don
t
like
the
fact
that
you
do
this
Of
course
if
you
have
explicit
user
consent
no
problem
but
otherwise
it
should
be
a
clear
no
no
I
am
just
hoping
that
good
practice
websites
are
not
going
to
be
caught
up
with
the
bad
stuff
which
is
happening
at
present
Matt
Clarke
As
someone
heavily
involved
in
analytics
implementation
new
features
in
the
APIs
appeal
most
to
me
I
m
a
big
fan
of
event
tracking
so
the
non
interactive
event
tracking
addition
was
great
but
some
extra
custom
variables
wouldn
t
go
amiss
given
that
Premium
users
now
get
50
compared
to
the
mere
five
in
the
free
version
A
Google

server
side
import
API
would
also
be
nice
as
would
the
addition
of
some
additional
metrics
to
improve
the
quality
of
reporting
On
the
interface
side
the
enhancement
of
the
brilliant
new
reports
and
dashboards
tools
with
custom
calculated
metrics
would
be
the
icing
on
the
cake

Excellent
point
on
the
PII
bit
Dan
Maybe
we
ll
see
a
clarification
to
the
terms
of
use
this
year
Quite
a
few
people
seem
to
be
using
the
utma
cookie
visitor
ID
or
the
transaction
ID
which
are
the
same
as
a
primary
key
allowing
them
to
link
their
GA
data
to
their
CRM
for
offline
analysis
However
although
this
is
allowed
in
Premium
GA
it
s
apparently
not
in
the
free
version
though
I
ve
seen
a
few
people
disputing
this
If
it
were
allowed
it
would
definitely
take
things
to
another
level
Arguably
it
s
not
storing
anything
else
in
GA
since
the
ID
is
the
same
as
the
one
GA
issued
itself
and
it
s
not
really
personally
identifiable

some
of
which

I
personally
can
t

don
t
even
think
it
will
end
up
getting
to

It
would
be
comforting
to
believe
that
Tom
Hicks
is
right
and
we
can
ostrich
like
just
carry
on
regardless
with
no
repercussions
but
I
m
not
so
sure
Just
as
Matt
Clarke
highlighted
very
little
seems
to
have
been
done
to
address
the
issue
with
very
little
information
available
to
easily
comply
and
that
that
has
been
published
like
the
ICO
site
itself
does
not
lend
itself
to
a
very
pleasing
customer
experience
and
more
likely
to
annoy
than
provide
confidence

I

the

here
are
spot
on
but
I
can
t
help
thinking
it
s
a
shame
we
re
caught
up
in
the
PII
discussions
when
the
focus
could
be
on
the
true
innovation
what
will
happen
as
Brian
mentions
btw
the
lines
when
it
becomes
possible
to
mash
data
up
from
off
site
data
sources
for
me
that
s
the
next
big
innovation
and
it
ll
allow
us
to
become
able
to
understand
how
the
actual
audiences
behave
in
both
our
owned
media
but
also
in
paid
even
when
there
s
no
visit
to
our
owned
platforms
and
earned
media
The
ability
to
combine
behavioural
patterns
with
social
demographics
sentiment
and
customer
lifetime
values
off
and
online
will
disrupt
advertising
media
and
businesses
As
Dan
says
BI
and
web
analytics
will
move
closer
together
that
s
to
me
a
very
understated
way
of
saying
disruption

Great
thoughts
and
comments
Agree
100
that
privacy
and
tracking
will
be
a
big
issue
in
2012
Though
given
how
slowly
and
badly
many
companies
coped
with
previous
legislation
leads
me
to
agree
with
MC
that
many
will
simply
wait
and
see
before
making
significant
changes
I
m
looking
forward
to
working
with
clients
and
tying
the
online
journey
to
call
centre
activity
AdInsight
etc
to
significantly
boost
ROI
and
conversion
Also
Tag
Management
should
start
to
make
our
jobs
easier
so
we
can
spend
more
time
on
planning
and
analysis
and
less
on
the
tedious
cycle
of
waiting
several
months
to
deploy
changes

Interesting
that
you

only
mention
Google
Analtyics
here
According
to
the
E
Consultancy
2012
Web
Analytics
Buyers
guide
IBM
Adobe
and
others
are
kind
of
a
big
deal
too
GA
made
some
great
strides
last
year
with
more
to
come
but
it
still
has
a
way
to
go
before
it
can
claim
to
be
the
market
leader
You
can
also
count
on
IBM
Adobe
and
Webtrends
to
keep
innovating
too
making
this
a
very
interesting
tech
space
in
2012
For
me
the
biggest
challenge
in
2012
is
not
cookie
laws
It
is
the
same
problem
that
businesses
faced
in
2011
2010
2009
etc
which
is
actually
making
use
of
the
data
they
collect
A
study
by
MIT
recently
found
that
only
17
of
companies
use
more
than
75
of
the
data
they
capture
Most
clients
we
speak
to
have
set
their
analytics
up
with
little
or
no
customisation
and
focus
on
their
actual
business
model
If
data
is
the
new
oil
we
are
in
need
of
a
little
refinement
as

industry

Yes
there
are
a
lot
of
mentions
of
GA
but
this
is
because
it
is
so
popular
and
the
fact
that
Google
has
been
pretty
busy
in
this
area
recently
As
Dan
Barker
mentions
there
is
a
flaw
in
GA
which
means
that
other
analytics
tools
are
required
for
some
customer
tracking

neutral

Amazing
to
see
that
some
commentators
are
still
putting
their
heads
in
the
sand
about
the
cookie
law
Technically
it
is
not
difficult
http
www
cookielaw
org
The
challenge
of
the
law
is
to
find
new
ways
to
get
visitors
to
engage
so
they
will
provide
consent
I
think
this
will
be
a
good
thing
for
brands
in
the
long
run

A
lot
of
good
debate
converging
under
a
web
analytics
banner
and
to
be
honest
I
m
not
quite
sure
what
belongs
under
that
banner
any
more
so
it
s
a
tough
gig
to
do
the
crystal
ball
gazing
I
suspect
the
convergence
of
web
analytics
and
business
intelligence
hinted
at
above
is
much
closer
than
commonly
acknowledged
If
you
go
to
a
BI
conference
or
read
a
BI
forum
they
will
be
talking
about
actually
using
more
of
the
data
collected
better
visualisations
mashing
up
data
from
multiple
sources
predictive
analytics
big
data
platforms
dynamic
pricing
etc
etc
All
of
these
are
important
industry
trends
around
managing
data
and
driving
business
value
from
it
and
while
the
sources
might
be
different
I
struggle
to
see
much
real
divergence
in
the
underlying
objectives
and
technologies
So
what
is
left
in
the
mix
for
pure
web
analytics
trends
1
2012
will
be
the
year
that
we
start
to
look
at
web
analytics
as
ultimately
being
Just
Another
Data
Source
The
privacy
legislation
is
a
key
catalyst
for
this
because
like
it
or
lump
it
we
now
have
to
at
the
very
least
think
carefully
about
exactly
what
we
re
capturing
and
why
and
the
resulting
quality
of
that
data
rather
than
just
stockpiling
it
and
hoping
to
make
sense
of
it
later
And
looking
at
web
analytics
data
in
isolation
is
just
not
going
to
cut
the
mustard
anymore
2
Google
does
unavoidably
make
this
sector
unique
notably
there
is
no
Google
equivalent
in
the
wider
data
industry
hence
why
the
Big
G
keeps
coming
up
in
any
web
analytics
commentary
However
I
think
the
biggest
technology
trends
in
2012
will
or
at
least
should
be
driven
by
how
other
vendors
respond
to
the
Google
Analytics
Premium
proposition
unless
Google
themselves
pull
out
another
significant
rabbit
from
the
hat
before
the
end
of
the
year
Data
is
the
new
oil
finite
volatile
political
polluting
Should
be
an
exciting
year
anyway

To
follow
on
from
Rob
s
comment
I
should
probably
point
out
that
although
Google
Analytics
now
serves
95
of
sites
that
doesn
t
mean
GA
is
the
ONLY
web
analytics
tool
being
used
on
those
sites
I
have
worked
for
3
of
the
major
paid
for
web
analytics
companies
and
the
majority
of
the
clients
at
all
three
use
GA
in
combination
with
other
more
sophisticated
tools
I
m
only
trying
to
show
that
although
GA
is
ubiquitous
these
days
it
doesn
t
own
the
market
just
yet

My
main
themes
for
2012
are
as
follows
All
business
areas
will
start
to
demand
direct
access
to
data
and
insights
As
waves
of
young
recruits
arrive
in
existing
functions
they
will
demand
statistics
in
a
way
which
previous
generations
have
not
Analysts
will
be
challenged
to
empower
and
guide
these
individuals
to
ensure
responsible
analysis
and
interpretation
of
statistics
Analytics
related
tools
will
continue
to
plummet
in
price
for
two
reasons
Firstly
Google
and
its
constantly
improving
free
tools
Secondly
SMBs
are
requiring
similar
capabilities
as
large
enterprises
vendors
will
see
the
benefit
of
many
smaller
clients
vs
a
few
large
ones
SEO
knowledge
will
continue
to
be
democratised
partly
by
Google
continuing
to
give
us
tools
and
knowledge
to
undestand
it
Analysts
will
need
to
be
able
to
cope
with
first
line
SEO
challenges
without
recourse
to
specialists
Web
analytics
will
grow
up
and
be
seen
as
just
another
source
of
BI
We
will
benefit
from
not
being
special
and
hopefully
further
distance
ourselves
from
IT
Web
analytics
will
enjoy
being
taken
to
the
hearts
of
functions
outside
of
marketing
It
is
time
for
supply
chain
hr
finance
etc
to
become
serious
stakeholders
My
thoughts
so
far

Rob
funny
you
should
mention
functions
outside
marketing
At
AT
Internet
we
have
noticed
a
trend
with
our
enterprise
clients
where
WA
is
increasingly
owned
by
finance
and
not
marketing
I
believe
this
is
a
direct
reflection
of
the
importance
WA
data
plays
in
management
accounting
With
that
move
in
ownership
Web
Analytics
as
such
will
cease
to
exist
and
just
become
another
data
point
in
the
larger
BI
finance
system

You
can
comply
with
the
law
and
keep
GA
analytics
including
unique
visitor
statistics
by
only
allowing
cookies
if
visitors
have
agreed
You
need
a
sophisticated
client
side
solution
to
do
it
though

also
allows
you
to

IBM
s
CMO
report
showed
that
big
data
was
a
major
headache
for
CMOs
In
2012
I
hope
to
see
web
analytics
tools
getting
better
at
coping
with
other
business
data
We
enjoy
superb
UI
s
in
the
web
analytics
tools
and
if
that
simplicity
could
be
combined
with
real
business
insights
then
we
could
be
on
to
a
winner
SoMoLo
Social
Mobile
and
Local
analytics
are
being
heavily
touted
by
Avinash
Kaushik
and
I
think
this
will
have
a
larger
part
to
play
in
enterprise
web
analytics
Finally
the
intelligence
offered
by
web
analytics
will
need
to
improve
as
they
move
from
being
data
and
information
tools
to
being
truly
intelligent
Cookie
laws
are
an
unfortunate
distraction
to
innovation
at
the
moment
in
my
opinion

2012
will
be
the
year
of
the
return
of
server
side
IP
tracking
analytics
in
the
UK
Because
most
analytics
software
is
cookie
based
and
an
explicit
permission
will
be
required
under
the
new
cookie
law
for
that
to
work
it
will
be
much
less
useful
than
hitherto
I
hope
that
Google
introduce
a
cookie
less
option
and
hook
in
their
script
that
can
look
for
an
explicit
opt
in
If
their
silence
continues
then
we
ll
have
no
choice
but
to
introduce
another
solution
either
in
paralel
with
Google
Analytics
or
instead
of
it

Like
others
that
have
commented
here
it
is
a
little
disappointing
to
hear
people
are
focusing
on
PII
as
a
limiting
factor
of
any
web
analytics
tool
It
is
by
far
a
small
segment
of
your
traffic
Typically
customers
account
for
around
3
5
of
your
web
traffic
and
that
is
being
generous
Many
many
sites
languish
in
the
1
3
bracket
I
consider
Customer
Analytics
that
is
where
you
have
the
PII
as
a
separate
though
obviously
related
discipline
to
web
analytics
For
me
Web
Analytics
is
about
exploring
the
HUGE
potential
and
possibilities
of
the
other
95
of
your
traffic
I
regularly
see
an
enormous
amount
of
money
and
resource
spent
on
acquiring
poor
quality
traffic
I
also
often
see
poorly
built
websites
built
around
either
what
looks
good
guess
work
and
what
the
competition
is
doing
Few
people
make
informed
data
driven
decisions
So
focus
on
the
bigger
piece
of
the
pie
Taking
an
e
commerce
conversion
rate
from
3
to
4
that
is
taking
an
anonymous
visitor
and
converting
them
into
a
tangible
customer
often
provides
an
increase
in
ROI
that
is
orders
of
magnitude
higher
than
anything
that
can
be
achieved
with
Customer
Analytics
Consider
this
According
to
2010
data
from
Forrester
Research
Inc
http
www
internetretailer
com
2010
09
28
key
profit
indicators
point
the
average
shopping
cart
abandonment
rate
for
U
S
online
retailers
is
55
percent
In
other
words
the
transaction
revenue
obtained
by
site
owners
is
approximately
half
that
customers
are
willing
to
and
are
in
the
process
of
spending
That
is
on
average
U
S
retailers
leave
1
of
the
money
on
the
table
for
every
1
collected
It
is
an
incredible
amount
of
money
when
you
consider
that
U
S
online
retail
is
predicted
to
be
worth
279

2015

We
ve
already
asked
industry
experts
about
what
2012
holds
for
search
and
e
commerce
now
it
s
the
turn
of
web
analytics
2011
was
a
busy
year
for
Google
Analytics
updates
as
well
as
the
EU
Privacy
law
and
our
experts
identify
the
issues
to
look
out
for
in
the
next
12
months
What
were
the
most
significant
trends
in
web
analytics
last
year
Brian
Clifton
Founder
of
Advanced
Web
Metrics
com
The
biggest
change
by
far
has
been
the
introduction
of
the
EU
Privacy
Law
that
came
into
effect
on
25th
May
2011
It
wasn
t
a
great
surprise
as
privacy
has
been
bubbling
below
the
surface
of
our
industry
for
the
last
five
years
see
my
post
Five
Predictions
For
Web
Analytics
in
2011
but
how
this
law
has
been
interpreted
did
shock
the
web
analytics
world
at
least
across
Europe
Sadly
the
ICO
the
Independent
Commissioner
s
Office
who
in
the
UK
are
responsible
for
providing
guidance
and
enforce
this
law
has
taken
the
view
that
benign
web
tracking
that
is
anonymous
and
aggregate
visit
data
collected
by
tools
such
as
Google
Analytics
are
not
allowed
to
do
so
without
explicit
consent
of
the
visitor
That
means
you
force
an
ugly
and
intrusive
pop
up
window
or
similar
notice
asking
your
visitors
for
consent
The
ICO
has
done
this
see
the
top
banner
of
their
site
and
seen
a
drop
of
90
in
the
traffic
they
are
able
to
measure
Imagine
the
impact
that
would
have
on
an
e
commerce
site
90
of
your
data
suddenly
lost
Clearly
this
is
wrong
The
focus
needs
to
be
on
the
abusers
of
online
tracking
not
people
following
best
practice
This
will
rumble
on
throughout
2012
for
sure
Matt
Clarke
E

As
a
Google
Analytics
end
user
2011
has
included
a
mixture
of
really
annoying
things
missing
data
sampled
data
missing
keywords
and
some
really
innovative
things
The
GA
team
has
certainly
been
very
busy
and
it
s
been
hard
to
keep
track
of
the
many
new
additions
they
ve
made
to
the
tool
In
just
12
months
we
ve
seen
the
introduction
of
site
speed
metrics
social
media
metrics
the
brilliant
multi
channel
funnels
improved
dashboards
and
reports
flow
analysis
and
code
improvements
to
event
tracking
and
the
API
Not
to
mention
Google
Analytics
Premium
for
those
big
enough
to
afford
it
Dan
Barker
E

consultant
The
Google
Analytics
updates
have
been
great
They
ve
updated
more
this
year
than
in
the
last
few
years
combined
I
think
the
move
toward
multi
visit
analysis
is
really
nice
and
that
will
only
continue
Pulling
in
different
types
of
off
site
data
is
also
really
interesting
and
I
d
bet
that
gets
extended
much
further
From
my
point
of
view
a
really
nice
trend
over
the
last
year
is
that
more
of
the
people
I
work
with
have
gone
from
asking
how
do
we
set
up
reports
to
what
can
we
do
with
this
data
My
dad
published
a
Kindle
book
this
year
after
having
realised
there
was
an
audience
for
it
on
the
basis
of
his
Google
Analytics
data
It
s
brilliant
to
see
lots
of
people
actually
using
all
this
amazing
data
that
s
available
What
s
on
the
horizon
for
2012
Matt
Clarke
The
thing
that
s
going
to
be
on
the
mind
of
everyone
who
operates
a
site
in
the
EU
is
the
forthcoming
cookie
legislation
which
is
due
to
be
enforced
from
May
I
m
sure
some
agencies
will
gain
new
business
by
offering
cookie
audits
policies
and
tools
to
obtain
permission
but
I
think
it
remains
to
be
seen
how
many
will
even
bother
to
implement
anything
particularly
initially
I
think
many
are
likely
to
see
what
their
competitors
do
and
look
at
the
methods
being
used
to
obtain
permission
as
those
proposed
so
far
haven
t
been
great
It
would
be
nice
if
this
problem
could
simply
be
passed
back
to
the
browser
developers
but
I
don
t
think
that
s
going
to
happen
The
analytics
tool
vendors
have
also
been
very
quiet
on
the
issue
I
m
hoping
that
it
will
be
possible
that
we
ll
be
able
to
avoid
prosecution
by
taking
fairly
simple
measures
that
don
t
significantly
harm
the
user
experience
Brian
Clifton
I
think
2012
could
be
the
year
that
the
long
standing
issue
of
integrating
offsite
metrics
with
onsite
metrics
comes
of
age
The
big
offsite
metrics
questions
are
what
people
and
how
many
are
saying
about
you
away
from
your
website
i
e
social
media
Because
this
happens
offsite
and
in
many
disparate
systems
networks
its
measurement
and
correlation
with
what
happens
on
your
site
has
so
far
not
been
an
easy
task
to
achieve
Dan
Barker
The
cookie
law
again
mobile
and
social
analytics
will
be
big
topics
next
year
I
think
multichannel
analytics
and
predictive
analytics
will
start
to
go
mainstream
too
and
that
automation
based
on
analytics
data
will
become
a
bit
easier
There
s
an
odd
situation
in
the
web
analytics
market
at
the
moment
in
that
Google
Analytics
now
serves
95
of
sites
The
big
flaw
in
Google
Analytics
is
that
it
doesn
t
let
you
track
personally
identifiable
information
so
you
can
t
use
it
to
answer
even
simple
questions
like
who
were
my
biggest
customers
this
year
what
s
bringing
them
to
the
website
and
how
often
are
they
visiting
To
get
those
answers
you
either
have
to
move
to
a
very
niche
web
analytics
tool
or
pay
mid
high
five
figures
Someone
is
bound
to
fix
that
soon
as
it
s
a
problem
that
exists
for
almost
every
website
and
it
s
weird
that
the
bulk
of
web
analytics
is
so
far
away
from
being
customer
centric
at
the
moment
BI
web
analytics
will
keep
moving
closer
together
and
by
the
end
of
the
year
someone
will
have
used
the
words
big
data
on
Question
Time
and
the
cast
of
TOWIE
will
have
had
a
punch
up
over
the
merits
of
NoSQL
What
s
on
your
wish
list
for
2012
Brian
Clifton
I
hope
that
a
better
understanding
of
privacy
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
solidifies
in
2012
Privacy
is
a
big
issue
for
anyone
online
it
is
simply
too
easy
at
present
for
this
to
be
abused
and
a
couple
of
high
profile
cases
could
really
harm
the
ability
of
website
owners
to
collect
the
benign
stuff
Bad
practice
has
to
go
so
in
general
the
new
EU
Privacy
Law
is
a
good
thing
Bad
practice
includes
the
surreptitious
collection
of
personal
identifiable
information
sharing
of
visit
information
with
3rd
parties
i
e
3rd
party
cookies
and
similar
techniques
and
the
tracking
of
visits
between
different
unrelated
websites
sorry
DoubleClick
I
don
t
like
the
fact
that
you
do
this
Of
course
if
you
have
explicit
user
consent
no
problem
but
otherwise
it
should
be
a
clear
no
no
I
am
just
hoping
that
good
practice
websites
are
not
going
to
be
caught
up
with
the
bad
stuff
which
is
happening
at
present
Matt
Clarke
As
someone
heavily
involved
in
analytics
implementation
new
features
in
the
APIs
appeal
most
to
me
I
m
a
big
fan
of
event
tracking
so
the
non
interactive
event
tracking
addition
was
great
but
some
extra
custom
variables
wouldn
t
go
amiss
given
that
Premium
users
now
get
50
compared
to
the
mere
five
in
the
free
version
A
Google
Analytics
server
side
import
API
would
also
be
nice
as
would
the
addition
of
some
additional
metrics
to
improve
the
quality
of
reporting
On
the
interface
side
the
enhancement
of
the
brilliant
new
reports
and
dashboards
tools
with
custom
calculated
metrics
would
be
the
icing
on
the
cake

Excellent
point
on
the
PII
bit
Dan
Maybe
we
ll
see
a
clarification
to
the
terms
of
use
this
year
Quite
a
few
people
seem
to
be
using
the
utma
cookie
visitor
ID
or
the
transaction
ID
which
are
the
same
as
a
primary
key
allowing
them
to
link
their
GA
data
to
their
CRM
for
offline
analysis
However
although
this
is
allowed
in
Premium
GA
it
s
apparently
not
in
the
free
version
though
I
ve
seen
a
few
people
disputing
this
If
it
were
allowed
it
would
definitely
take
things
to
another
level
Arguably
it
s
not
storing
anything
else
in
GA
since
the
ID
is
the
same
as
the
one
GA
issued
itself
and
it
s
not
really
personally
identifiable

Some

some
of
which
are

my
own
I
personally
can
t
see

don
t
even
think
it
will
end
up
getting
to

stage
Rob

It
would
be
comforting
to
believe
that
Tom
Hicks
is
right
and
we
can
ostrich
like
just
carry
on
regardless
with
no
repercussions
but
I
m
not
so
sure
Just
as
Matt
Clarke
highlighted
very
little
seems
to
have
been
done
to
address
the
issue
with
very
little
information
available
to
easily
comply
and
that
that
has
been
published
like
the
ICO
site
itself
does
not
lend
itself
to
a
very
pleasing
customer
experience
and
more
likely
to
annoy
than
provide
confidence

I

the

here
are
spot
on
but
I
can
t
help
thinking
it
s
a
shame
we
re
caught
up
in
the
PII
discussions
when
the
focus
could
be
on
the
true
innovation
what
will
happen
as
Brian
mentions
btw
the
lines
when
it
becomes
possible
to
mash
data
up
from
off
site
data
sources
for
me
that
s
the
next
big
innovation
and
it
ll
allow
us
to
become
able
to
understand
how
the
actual
audiences
behave
in
both
our
owned
media
but
also
in
paid
even
when
there
s
no
visit
to
our
owned
platforms
and
earned
media
The
ability
to
combine
behavioural
patterns
with
social
demographics
sentiment
and
customer
lifetime
values
off
and
online
will
disrupt
advertising
media
and
businesses
As
Dan
says
BI
and
web
analytics
will
move
closer
together
that
s
to
me
a
very
understated
way
of
saying
disruption

Great
thoughts
and
comments
Agree
100
that
privacy
and
tracking
will
be
a
big
issue
in
2012
Though
given
how
slowly
and
badly
many
companies
coped
with
previous
legislation
leads
me
to
agree
with
MC
that
many
will
simply
wait
and
see
before
making
significant
changes
I
m
looking
forward
to
working
with
clients
and
tying
the
online
journey
to
call
centre
activity
AdInsight
etc
to
significantly
boost
ROI
and
conversion
Also
Tag
Management
should
start
to
make
our
jobs
easier
so
we
can
spend
more
time
on
planning
and
analysis
and
less
on
the
tedious
cycle
of
waiting
several
months
to
deploy
changes

Interesting
that
you
guys
only
mention
Google
Analtyics
here
According
to
the
E
Consultancy
2012
Web
Analytics
Buyers
guide
IBM
Adobe
and
others
are
kind
of
a
big
deal
too
GA
made
some
great
strides
last
year
with
more
to
come
but
it
still
has
a
way
to
go
before
it
can
claim
to
be
the
market
leader
You
can
also
count
on
IBM
Adobe
and
Webtrends
to
keep
innovating
too
making
this
a
very
interesting
tech
space
in
2012
For
me
the
biggest
challenge
in
2012
is
not
cookie
laws
It
is
the
same
problem
that
businesses
faced
in
2011
2010
2009
etc
which
is
actually
making
use
of
the
data
they
collect
A
study
by
MIT
recently
found
that
only
17
of
companies
use
more
than
75
of
the
data
they
capture
Most
clients
we
speak
to
have
set
their
analytics
up
with
little
or
no
customisation
and
focus
on
their
actual
business
model
If
data
is
the
new
oil
we
are
in
need
of
a
little
refinement
as
an
industry

Yes
there
are
a
lot
of
mentions
of
GA
but
this
is
because
it
is
so
popular
and
the
fact
that
Google
has
been
pretty
busy
in
this
area
recently
As
Dan
Barker
mentions
there
is
a
flaw
in
GA
which
means
that
other
analytics
tools
are
required
for
some
customer
tracking

Amazing
to
see
that
some
commentators
are
still
putting
their
heads
in
the
sand
about
the
cookie
law
Technically
it
is
not
difficult
http
www
cookielaw
org
The
challenge
of
the
law
is
to
find
new
ways
to
get
visitors
to
engage
so
they
will
provide
consent
I
think
this
will
be
a
good
thing
for
brands
in
the
long
run

A
lot
of
good
debate
converging
under
a
web
analytics
banner
and
to
be
honest
I
m
not
quite
sure
what
belongs
under
that
banner
any
more
so
it
s
a
tough
gig
to
do
the
crystal
ball
gazing
I
suspect
the
convergence
of
web
analytics
and
business
intelligence
hinted
at
above
is
much
closer
than
commonly
acknowledged
If
you
go
to
a
BI
conference
or
read
a
BI
forum
they
will
be
talking
about
actually
using
more
of
the
data
collected
better
visualisations
mashing
up
data
from
multiple
sources
predictive
analytics
big
data
platforms
dynamic
pricing
etc
etc
All
of
these
are
important
industry
trends
around
managing
data
and
driving
business
value
from
it
and
while
the
sources
might
be
different
I
struggle
to
see
much
real
divergence
in
the
underlying
objectives
and
technologies
So
what
is
left
in
the
mix
for
pure
web
analytics
trends
1
2012
will
be
the
year
that
we
start
to
look
at
web
analytics
as
ultimately
being
Just
Another
Data
Source
The
privacy
legislation
is
a
key
catalyst
for
this
because
like
it
or
lump
it
we
now
have
to
at
the
very
least
think
carefully
about
exactly
what
we
re
capturing
and
why
and
the
resulting
quality
of
that
data
rather
than
just
stockpiling
it
and
hoping
to
make
sense
of
it
later
And
looking
at
web
analytics
data
in
isolation
is
just
not
going
to
cut
the
mustard
anymore
2
Google
does
unavoidably
make
this
sector
unique
notably
there
is
no
Google
equivalent
in
the
wider
data
industry
hence
why
the
Big
G
keeps
coming
up
in
any
web
analytics
commentary
However
I
think
the
biggest
technology
trends
in
2012
will
or
at
least
should
be
driven
by
how
other
vendors
respond
to
the
Google
Analytics
Premium
proposition
unless
Google
themselves
pull
out
another
significant
rabbit
from
the
hat
before
the
end
of
the
year
Data
is
the
new
oil
finite
volatile
political
polluting
Should
be
an
exciting
year
anyway

To
follow
on
from
Rob
s
comment
I
should
probably
point
out
that
although
Google
Analytics
now
serves
95
of
sites
that
doesn
t
mean
GA
is
the
ONLY
web
analytics
tool
being
used
on
those
sites
I
have
worked
for
3
of
the
major
paid
for
web
analytics
companies
and
the
majority
of
the
clients
at
all
three
use
GA
in
combination
with
other
more
sophisticated
tools
I
m
only
trying
to
show
that
although
GA
is
ubiquitous
these
days
it
doesn
t
own
the
market
just
yet

My
main
themes
for
2012
are
as
follows
All
business
areas
will
start
to
demand
direct
access
to
data
and
insights
As
waves
of
young
recruits
arrive
in
existing
functions
they
will
demand
statistics
in
a
way
which
previous
generations
have
not
Analysts
will
be
challenged
to
empower
and
guide
these
individuals
to
ensure
responsible
analysis
and
interpretation
of
statistics
Analytics
related
tools
will
continue
to
plummet
in
price
for
two
reasons
Firstly
Google
and
its
constantly
improving
free
tools
Secondly
SMBs
are
requiring
similar
capabilities
as
large
enterprises
vendors
will
see
the
benefit
of
many
smaller
clients
vs
a
few
large
ones
SEO
knowledge
will
continue
to
be
democratised
partly
by
Google
continuing
to
give
us
tools
and
knowledge
to
undestand
it
Analysts
will
need
to
be
able
to
cope
with
first
line
SEO
challenges
without
recourse
to
specialists
Web
analytics
will
grow
up
and
be
seen
as
just
another
source
of
BI
We
will
benefit
from
not
being
special
and
hopefully
further
distance
ourselves
from
IT
Web
analytics
will
enjoy
being
taken
to
the
hearts
of
functions
outside
of
marketing
It
is
time
for
supply
chain
hr
finance
etc
to
become
serious
stakeholders
My
thoughts
so
far

Rob
funny
you
should
mention
functions
outside
marketing
At
AT
Internet
we
have
noticed
a
trend
with
our
enterprise
clients
where
WA
is
increasingly
owned
by
finance
and
not
marketing
I
believe
this
is
a
direct
reflection
of
the
importance
WA
data
plays
in
management
accounting
With
that
move
in
ownership
Web
Analytics
as
such
will
cease
to
exist
and
just
become
another
data
point
in
the
larger
BI
finance
system

You
can
comply
with
the
law
and
keep
GA
analytics
including
unique
visitor
statistics
by
only
allowing
cookies
if
visitors
have
agreed
You
need
a
sophisticated
client
side
solution
to
do
it
though

also
allows
you
to

by

no

IBM
s
CMO
report
showed
that
big
data
was
a
major
headache
for
CMOs
In
2012
I
hope
to
see
web
analytics
tools
getting
better
at
coping
with
other
business
data
We
enjoy
superb
UI
s
in
the
web
analytics
tools
and
if
that
simplicity
could
be
combined
with
real
business
insights
then
we
could
be
on
to
a
winner
SoMoLo
Social
Mobile
and
Local
analytics
are
being
heavily
touted
by
Avinash
Kaushik
and
I
think
this
will
have
a
larger
part
to
play
in
enterprise
web
analytics
Finally
the
intelligence
offered
by
web
analytics
will
need
to
improve
as
they
move
from
being
data
and
information
tools
to
being
truly
intelligent
Cookie
laws
are
an
unfortunate
distraction
to
innovation

the
moment

my
opinion

2012
will
be
the
year
of
the
return
of
server
side
IP
tracking
analytics
in
the
UK
Because
most
analytics
software
is
cookie
based
and
an
explicit
permission
will
be
required
under
the
new
cookie
law
for
that
to
work
it
will
be
much
less
useful
than
hitherto
I
hope
that
Google
introduce
a
cookie
less
option
and
hook
in
their
script
that
can
look
for
an
explicit
opt
in
If
their
silence
continues
then
we
ll
have
no
choice
but
to
introduce
another
solution
either
in
paralel
with
Google
Analytics
or
instead
of
it

Like
others
that
have
commented
here
it
is
a
little
disappointing
to
hear
people
are
focusing
on
PII
as
a
limiting
factor
of
any
web
analytics
tool
It
is
by
far
a
small
segment
of
your
traffic
Typically
customers
account
for
around
3
5
of
your
web
traffic
and
that
is
being
generous
Many
many
sites
languish
in
the
1
3
bracket
I
consider
Customer
Analytics
that
is
where
you
have
the
PII
as
a
separate
though
obviously
related
discipline
to
web
analytics
For
me
Web
Analytics
is
about
exploring
the
HUGE
potential
and
possibilities
of
the
other
95
of
your
traffic
I
regularly
see
an
enormous
amount
of
money
and
resource
spent
on
acquiring
poor
quality
traffic
I
also
often
see
poorly
built
websites
built
around
either
what
looks
good
guess
work
and
what
the
competition
is
doing
Few
people
make
informed
data
driven
decisions
So
focus
on
the
bigger
piece
of
the
pie
Taking
an
e
commerce
conversion
rate
from
3
to
4
that
is
taking
an
anonymous
visitor
and
converting
them
into
a
tangible
customer
often
provides
an
increase
in
ROI
that
is
orders
of
magnitude
higher
than
anything
that
can
be
achieved
with
Customer
Analytics
Consider
this
According
to
2010
data
from
Forrester
Research
Inc
http
www
internetretailer
com
2010
09
28
key
profit
indicators
point
the
average
shopping
cart
abandonment
rate
for
U
S
online
retailers
is
55
percent
In
other
words
the
transaction
revenue
obtained
by
site
owners
is
approximately
half
that
customers
are
willing
to
and
are
in
the
process
of
spending
That
is
on
average
U
S
retailers
leave
1
of
the
money
on
the
table
for
every
1
collected
It
is
an
incredible
amount
of
money
when
you
consider
that
U
S
online
retail
is
predicted
to
be
worth
279

2015

Google
s
Panda
update
was
a
direct
attack
on
bad
content
which
comes
in
many
different
flavours
including
duplicate
weak
thin
and
template
Panda
acts
like
a
domain
wide
penalty
so
your
whole
site
is
affected
and
your
good
pages
are
dragged
down
by
your
bad
pages
This
is
a
guide
on
how
to
find
and
fix
Google
s
Panda
algorithm
update
based
on
our
Panda
fighting
experience
at
SEOgadget
in
2011
Panda
basics
Panda
is
about
dealing
with
bad
content
not
bad
links
Bad
content
comes
in
different
flavours
duplicate
weak
thin
and
template
Panda
acts
like
a
domain
wide
penalty
your
whole
site
is
affected
and
your
good
stuff
is
dragged
down
by
your
bad
stuff
Web
crawler
accessibility
issues
affect
how
search
engines
see
and
therefore
assess
your
content
Often
badly
designed
Information
Architectures
compound
the
problems
with
already
week
content
Large
sites
that
have
many
pages
templated
content
and
lots
of
sub
categories
are
the
most
at
risk
If
you
haven
t
been
monitoring
and
fixing
your
accessibility
issues
as
highlighted
in
Google
Webmaster
Tools
you
are
at
risk
Panda
examples
All
of
these
examples
are
from
the
UK
mostly
from
the
employment
and
gift
sectors
Classic
Panda
We
use
Searchmetric
s
SEO
visibility
score
to
find
out
just
when
sites
got
hit
or
recovered
from
Panda
There
are
three
dates
that
stick
out
in
the
UK
data
Early
April
was
the
big
UK
introduction
of
Panda
There
is
a
smaller
inflection
in
July
There
is
a
bigger
inflection
in
October
Proof
that
doing
nothing
will
not
help
you
You
can
see
in
this
graph
that
they
are
trying
to
fix
their
Panda
issues
but
haven
t
yet
bitten
the
bullet
and
made
the
leap
they
need
to
I
know
these
guys
well
They
have
no
idea
this
data
exists
or
anything
about
panda
but
they
have
done
OK
One
might
argue
that
they
are
OK
because
they
couldn
t
care
less
about
SEO
and
have
a
product
that
people
like
It
would
be
easy
to
attribute
this
to
Panda
but
this
looks
more
like
developer
or
general
website
issues
One
of
my
favourites
from
the
Employment
industry
which
clearly
shows
winners
and
losers
I
love
the
green
line
Did
they
even
know
they
had
benefited
from
Google
Panda
Did
they
think
they
had
done
something
to
deserve
the
new
traffic
Was
it
all
Champagne
cocaine
and
cash
bonuses
and
then
three
months
later
the
next
panda
update
smacks
them
With
Panda
thinning
out
sites
in
a
vertical
it
creates
a
false
sense
of
success
for
the
winners
as
they
themselves
may
be
next
in
line
for
the
chopping
block
The
blue
line
benefits
from
the
first
Panda
update
and
then
it
looks
like
they
get
hit
by
Panda
a
few
months
later
but
I
don
t
think
that
s
Panda
I
think
that
s
development
gone
wrong
Panda
smacks
and
recovery
are
one
day
to
the
next
not
across
a
number
of
weeks
The
other
effect
of
Panda
the
big
brands
got
bigger
Given
this
graph
where
would
you
go
to
look
for
examples
of
sites
that
are
being
rewarded
by
Google
Panda
Find
the
websites
that
benefitted
from
Panda
and
look
at
their
content
as
that
is
now
the
new
minimum
level
of
content
quality
in
your
industry
Panda
recovery
This
data
is
for
Prezzybox
who
we
worked
with
Panda
recovery
is
possible
but
a
lot
of
unplanned
un
budgeted
blood
sweat
tears
and
money
went
into
that
dip
and
recovering
the
traffic
The
SEO
visibility
metric
is
a
proprietary
metric
but
I
asked
Steve
Overton
from
Searchmetrics
if
he
could
give
us
some
more
insight
into
it
and
he
has
explained
the
algorithm
behind
it
Observations
from
fighting
Panda
Panda
is
confusing
if
you
are
not
on
top
of
your
data
and
industry
news
There
were
so
many
updates
it
becomes
easy
to
blame
everything
bad
on
Panda
Conversely
there
are
sites
which
benefitted
from
Panda
but
did
not
attribute
it
When
we
started
exploring
how
to
fix
Panda
we
moved
quite
conservatively
Now
we
suggest
that
people
take
strong
decisive
action
in
resolving
issues
Google
Panda
doesn
t
fix
itself
you
have
to
fix
it
It
will
take
time
money
and
effort
It
also
requires
a
change
in
how
you
see
your
online
business
You
can
make
this
whole
process
a
lot
easier
on
your
business
if
you
put
a
person
in
charge
of
content
and
give
them
a
budget
and
developer
time
The
advice
is
quite
simple
concentrated
around
a
few
key
areas
The
implementation
is
where
companies
fall
down
Fixing
Panda
is
not
complex
but
it
does
require
a
lot
of
work
How
to
fix
Panda
Duplicate
content
Give
someone
the
responsibility
to
hunt
down
duplicate
content
Use
Google
Webmaster
tools
or
SEOmoz
tools
or
Xenu
or
an
IIS
crawl
or
whatever
people
suggest
in
the
blog
comments
It
s
not
tough
to
do
it
just
requires
some
concentrated
effort
Solve
duplicate
content
issues
with
rel
canonical
Here
are
seven
short
videos
of
Google
s
Matt
Cutts
talking
about
different
aspects
of
implementing
rel
canonical
Thin
content
If
you
have
a
section
that
is
just
thin
templated
content
it
is
hurting
the
good
contents
ability
to
rank
Be
strong
and
cut
the
crap
or
add
to
your
content
to
improve
it
Cutting
the
crap
404
a
bad
section
or
area
and
after
the
pages
have
dropped
out
of
the
index
301
them
somewhere
good
so
you
don
t
lose
any
incoming
link
juice
This
is
potentially
the
biggest
win
SEOmoz
has
a
good
guide
to
301s
including
links
to
references
for
301s
under
Apache
and
IIS
Making
your
content
great
There
is
no
getting
around
the
fact
that
time
and
effort
is
needed
here
Someone
in
your
organisation
needs
the
time
and
responsibility
to
sit
down
and
create
great
content
or
manage
the
creation
process
via
third
party
writers
I
believe
that
great
content
requires
both
qualitative
and
quantitative
research
and
a
knowledgably
person
to
knit
it
together
to
suit
both
users
and
search
engines
Here
is
my
guide
on
taking
mediocre
content
and
making
it
great
content
and
an
overview
from
our
work
on
Panda
on
how
Google
might
interpret
content
quality
signals
Templated
content
Write
content
hire
interns
or
find
people
in
cheaper
parts
of
the
world
Many
companies
are
unnecessarily
precious
about
their
content
and
ultimately
this
ends
up
hurting
more
than
helping
them
Elance
Odesk
and
Copify
all
work
for
building
out
content
Remember
you
now
have
a
person
responsible
for
content
quality
who
will
oversee
this
Accessibility
issues
Run
an
IIS
crawl
to
find
your
accessibility
issues
IIS
is
easier
to
use
than
you
think
Here
is
an
example
list
of
errors
from
an
IIS
crawl
This
becomes
your
plan
of
attack
for
clearing
up
accessibility
issues
You
will
end
up
with
a
list
of
issues
and
the
urls
where
those
issues
are
occurring
to
be
able
to
go
and
fix
them
Three
key
takeaways
The
world
is
not
as
it
once
was
Crap
websites
trying
to
masquerade
as
decent
websites
are
being
hunted
down
and
sunk
below
the
quality
line
Google
owes
you
nothing
Tactics
to
just
barely
raise
your
quality
enough
to
recover
your
rankings
are
unlikely
to
pay
dividends
You
may
well
find
yourself
a
loser
again
the
next
time
the
quality
bar
is
raised
Google
is
judging
you
Google
is
going
to
continue
to
raise
the
quality
bar
with
future
updates
When
your
competitors
improve
their
websites
you
will
be
weakest
and
in
line
for
the
chop
at
the
next
quality
update
I
hope
this
post
helps
you
decide
to
build
great
content
today
so
you
dont
have
to
deal
with
the
fallout
from
bad
content
tomorrow

Believe
it

the

The
panda
update
was
a
reminder
that
quality
beats
quantity
every
time
I
d
caution
against
hiring
an
intern
or
a
foreign
writer
to
handle
your
content
It
may
be
cheap
but
you
get
what
you
pay

You
may
be
right
that
Many
companies
are
unnecessarily
precious
about
their
content
but
I
m
not
sure
that
s
the
real
problem
I
d
say
that
they
re
precious
about
the
wrong
things
Companies
should
be
precious
demanding
insistent
on
really
good
content
But
that
s
content
that
s
absolutely
right
for
their
customer
It
s
not
stuff
that
makes
the
board
feel
good

Google
s
Panda
update
was
a
direct
attack
on
bad
content
which
comes
in
many
different
flavours
including
duplicate
weak
thin
and
template
Panda
acts
like
a
domain
wide
penalty
so
your
whole
site
is
affected
and
your
good
pages
are
dragged
down
by
your
bad
pages
This
is
a
guide
on
how
to
find
and
fix
Google
s
Panda
algorithm
update
based
on
our
Panda
fighting
experience
at
SEOgadget
in
2011
Panda
basics
Panda
is
about
dealing
with
bad
content
not
bad
links
Bad
content
comes
in
different
flavours
duplicate
weak
thin
and
template
Panda
acts
like
a
domain
wide
penalty
your
whole
site
is
affected
and
your
good
stuff
is
dragged
down
by
your
bad
stuff
Web
crawler
accessibility
issues
affect
how
search
engines
see
and
therefore
assess
your
content
Often
badly
designed
Information
Architectures
compound
the
problems
with
already
week
content
Large
sites
that
have
many
pages
templated
content
and
lots
of
sub
categories
are
the
most
at
risk
If
you
haven
t
been
monitoring
and
fixing
your
accessibility
issues
as
highlighted
in
Google
Webmaster
Tools
you
are
at
risk
Panda
examples
All
of
these
examples
are
from
the
UK
mostly
from
the
employment
and
gift
sectors
Classic
Panda
We
use
Searchmetric
s
SEO
visibility
score
to
find
out
just
when
sites
got
hit
or
recovered
from
Panda
There
are
three
dates
that
stick
out
in
the
UK
data
Early
April
was
the
big
UK
introduction
of
Panda
There
is
a
smaller
inflection
in
July
There
is
a
bigger
inflection
in
October
Proof
that
doing
nothing
will
not
help
you
You
can
see
in
this
graph
that
they
are
trying
to
fix
their
Panda
issues
but
haven
t
yet
bitten
the
bullet
and
made
the
leap
they
need
to
I
know
these
guys
well
They
have
no
idea
this
data
exists
or
anything
about
panda
but
they
have
done
OK
One
might
argue
that
they
are
OK
because
they
couldn
t
care
less
about
SEO
and
have
a
product
that
people
like
It
would
be
easy
to
attribute
this
to
Panda
but
this
looks
more
like
developer
or
general
website
issues
One
of
my
favourites
from
the
Employment
industry
which
clearly
shows
winners
and
losers
I
love
the
green
line
Did
they
even
know
they
had
benefited
from
Google
Panda
Did
they
think
they
had
done
something
to
deserve
the
new
traffic
Was
it
all
Champagne
cocaine
and
cash
bonuses
and
then
three
months
later
the
next
panda
update
smacks
them
With
Panda
thinning
out
sites
in
a
vertical
it
creates
a
false
sense
of
success
for
the
winners
as
they
themselves
may
be
next
in
line
for
the
chopping
block
The
blue
line
benefits
from
the
first
Panda
update
and
then
it
looks
like
they
get
hit
by
Panda
a
few
months
later
but
I
don
t
think
that
s
Panda
I
think
that
s
development
gone
wrong
Panda
smacks
and
recovery
are
one
day
to
the
next
not
across
a
number
of
weeks
The
other
effect
of
Panda
the
big
brands
got
bigger
Given
this
graph
where
would
you
go
to
look
for
examples
of
sites
that
are
being
rewarded
by
Google
Panda
Find
the
websites
that
benefitted
from
Panda
and
look
at
their
content
as
that
is
now
the
new
minimum
level
of
content
quality
in
your
industry
Panda
recovery
This
data
is
for
Prezzybox
who
we
worked
with
Panda
recovery
is
possible
but
a
lot
of
unplanned
un
budgeted
blood
sweat
tears
and
money
went
into
that
dip
and
recovering
the
traffic
The
SEO
visibility
metric
is
a
proprietary
metric
but
I
asked
Steve
Overton
from
Searchmetrics
if
he
could
give
us
some
more
insight
into
it
and
he
has
explained
the
algorithm
behind
it
Observations
from
fighting
Panda
Panda
is
confusing
if
you
are
not
on
top
of
your
data
and
industry
news
There
were
so
many
updates
it
becomes
easy
to
blame
everything
bad
on
Panda
Conversely
there
are
sites
which
benefitted
from
Panda
but
did
not
attribute
it
When
we
started
exploring
how
to
fix
Panda
we
moved
quite
conservatively
Now
we
suggest
that
people
take
strong
decisive
action
in
resolving
issues
Google
Panda
doesn
t
fix
itself
you
have
to
fix
it
It
will
take
time
money
and
effort
It
also
requires
a
change
in
how
you
see
your
online
business
You
can
make
this
whole
process
a
lot
easier
on
your
business
if
you
put
a
person
in
charge
of
content
and
give
them
a
budget
and
developer
time
The
advice
is
quite
simple
concentrated
around
a
few
key
areas
The
implementation
is
where
companies
fall
down
Fixing
Panda
is
not
complex
but
it
does
require
a
lot
of
work
How
to
fix
Panda
Duplicate
content
Give
someone
the
responsibility
to
hunt
down
duplicate
content
Use
Google
Webmaster
tools
or
SEOmoz
tools
or
Xenu
or
an
IIS
crawl
or
whatever
people
suggest
in
the
blog
comments
It
s
not
tough
to
do
it
just
requires
some
concentrated
effort
Solve
duplicate
content
issues
with
rel
canonical
Here
are
seven
short
videos
of
Google
s
Matt
Cutts
talking
about
different
aspects
of
implementing
rel
canonical
Thin
content
If
you
have
a
section
that
is
just
thin
templated
content
it
is
hurting
the
good
contents
ability
to
rank
Be
strong
and
cut
the
crap
or
add
to
your
content
to
improve
it

a
bad
section
or
area
and
after
the
pages
have
dropped
out
of
the
index
301
them
somewhere
good
so
you
don
t
lose
any
incoming
link
juice
This
is
potentially
the
biggest
win
SEOmoz
has
a
good
guide
to

including

references
for

under
Apache
and

Making
your
content
great
There
is
no
getting
around
the
fact
that
time
and
effort
is
needed
here
Someone
in
your
organisation
needs
the
time
and
responsibility
to
sit
down
and
create
great
content
or
manage
the
creation
process
via
third
party
writers
I
believe
that
great
content
requires
both
qualitative
and
quantitative
research
and
a
knowledgably
person
to
knit
it
together
to
suit
both
users
and
search
engines
Here
is
my
guide
on
taking
mediocre
content
and
making
it
great
content
and
an
overview
from
our
work
on
Panda
on
how
Google
might
interpret
content
quality
signals
Templated
content
Write
content
hire
interns
or
find
people
in
cheaper
parts
of
the
world
Many
companies
are
unnecessarily
precious
about
their
content
and
ultimately
this
ends
up
hurting
more
than
helping
them
Elance
Odesk
and
Copify
all
work
for
building
out
content
Remember
you
now
have
a
person
responsible
for
content
quality
who
will
oversee
this
Accessibility
issues
Run
an
IIS
crawl
to
find
your
accessibility
issues
IIS
is
easier
to
use
than
you
think
Here
is
an
example
list
of
errors
from
an
IIS
crawl
This
becomes
your
plan
of
attack
for
clearing
up
accessibility
issues
You
will
end
up
with
a
list
of
issues
and
the
urls
where
those
issues
are
occurring
to
be
able
to
go
and
fix
them
Three
key
takeaways
The
world
is
not
as
it
once
was
Crap
websites
trying
to
masquerade
as
decent
websites
are
being
hunted
down
and
sunk
below
the
quality
line
Google
owes
you
nothing
Tactics
to
just
barely
raise
your
quality
enough
to
recover
your
rankings
are
unlikely
to
pay
dividends
You
may
well
find
yourself
a
loser
again
the
next
time
the
quality
bar
is
raised
Google
is
judging
you
Google
is
going
to
continue
to
raise
the
quality
bar
with
future
updates
When
your
competitors
improve
their
websites
you
will
be
weakest
and
in
line
for
the
chop
at
the
next
quality
update
I
hope
this
post
helps
you
decide
to
build
great
content
today
so
you
dont
have
to
deal
with
the
fallout
from
bad
content
tomorrow

was
a

that

every

caution
against
hiring

a

to
handle

You
may
be
right
that
Many
companies
are
unnecessarily
precious
about
their
content
but
I
m
not
sure
that
s
the
real
problem
I
d
say
that
they
re
precious
about
the
wrong
things
Companies
should
be
precious
demanding
insistent
on
really
good
content
But
that
s
content
that
s
absolutely
right
for
their
customer
It
s
not
stuff
that
makes
the
board
feel
good

With
the
introduction
of
payment
via
mobile
and
a
new
and
updated
app
is
this
a
new
mobile
era
for
Starbucks
What
opportunities
are
there
for
other
retailers
to
follow
suit
I
love
Starbucks
and
am
a
regular
down
at
my
local
Starbucks
s
note
the
plural
I
was
very
impressed
to
see
this
month
that
the
company
has
embraced
mobile
technology
throughout
its
stores
with
gusto
As
the
New
Year
rolled
in
Starbucks
rolled
out
a
new
app
which
allowed
people
to
register
their
Starbucks
card
and
then
with
some
new
mobile
scanners
installed
pay
in
store
with
their
mobile
phones
Starbucks
has
clearly
decided
that
mobile
is
the
way
forward
with
what
must
have
been
a
large
infrastructure
investment
although
it
has
decided
not
to
bother
with
near
field
communication
NFC
as
yet
Whether
this
is
because
a
large
number
of
their
customers
are
IOS
users
which
doesn
t
currently
have
this
built
in
time
will
tell
Already
one
in
five
of
Starbucks
customers
pay
for
their
purchases
using
their
reward
card
enticed
by
the
offers
of
free
Wi
Fi
and
a
free
drink
as
a
reward
for
15
in
store
visits
With
this
new
app
my
debit
card
is
linked
to
my
reward
card
which
is
linked
to
my
phone
so
when
I
am
in
desperate
need
of
a
coffee
or
a
calming
half
hour
in
Starbucks
all
I
need
is
my
phone
which
I
m
never
without
Why
would
I
now
pay
for
my
Starbucks
any
other
way
T
he
additional
data
capture
possibilities
for
Starbucks
are
endless
Data
such
as
favourite
drinks
date
of
birth
Frequently
visited
stores
and
number
of
visits
Purchase
trends
and
segmented
customers
Dynamic
offers
promotions
and
communications
I
m
sure
mobile
will
be
a
success
for
Starbucks
and
will
pave
the
way
for
more
retailers
to
invest
in
mobile
technologies
which
ultimately
make
purchasing
easier
for
customers
But
what
could
this
mean
for
other
retailers
both
on
our
streets
and
off
Here
s
just
some
of
our
more
immediate
predictions
Clothes
retailers
marketing
accessories
and
additional
pieces
to
create
a
capsule
wardrobe
depending
on
previous
purchase
history
via
mobile
connection
Lunch
chains
to
develop
mobile
ordering
with
instore
collection
and
payment
via
mobile
Development
of
webcam
technology
to
allow
e
commerce
purchases
by
showing
a
mobile
screen
to
your
webcam
Starbucks
has
really
set
the
mobile
commerce
bar
high
for
2012
My
prediction
This
is
the
year
that
retailers
and
the
public
will
embrace
mobile
for
mutual
satisfaction

I
ve
been
using
this
since
they
launched
in
Canada
late
2011
and
its
really
great
One

thing
is
that
they
snail
mail
you
the
bonus
drink
voucher
with
gold
status
you
get
a

every

Starbucks
are
clearly
a
leader
in
understanding
how
their
customers
use
mobile
then
incorporating
that
understanding
into
the
digital
experiences
they
provide
Working
with
them
on
their
mobile
web
experience
it
was
clear
they
had
invested
in
the
people
and
practices
to
learn
and
build
fast
Very
few
other
companies
are
keeping
up
and
pushing
technologies
like
responsive
design
and
the
Mobify
Platform
with
as
much
innovation
Starbucks
are
leading
and
extending
that
lead

Why
would
I
now
pay
for
my
Starbucks
any
other
way
Because
it
s
clunky
and
slow
and
the
staff
don
t
always
understand
how
to
use
it
Probably
being
slightly
unfair
but
I
have
switched
back
to
using
the
card
after
a
couple
of
attempts
with
the
app
because
the
app
takes
so
long
to
process
the
transaction
When
it
doesn
t
work
properly
Starbucks
staff
tend
to
be
unsure
of
what
to
do
The
key
thing
here
is
while
the
idea
is
great
the
systems
integration
and
training
has
to
be
equally
good
to
make
sure
it
s
a
viable
way
to
pay

Starbucks
are
leading
the
way
in
creating
mobile
and
social
strategies
which
listen
to
and
respond
to
their
customers
through
creating
new
products
and
experiences
which
are
in
line
with
their
customers
feedback
In
2010
Starbucks
customers
loaded
US
1
7bn
onto
their
pre
pay
reward
cards
and
if
you
look
at
Starbucks
operating
margin
of
13
you
could
look
at
this
as
their
customers
provided
a
cash
injection
of
US
220m
to
be
used
for
growth
projects
innovation
and
new
product
development
Add
to
cash
injection
a
more
indepth
understanding
of
the
starbucks
customer
through
their
mobile
buying
behaviour
their
social
insights
and
listening
strategies
their
branded
social
prescence
on
facebook
and
twitter
and
their
internal
customer
idea
community
mystarbucksidea
they
have
created
a
trusted
relationship
which
provides
the
opportunity
to
work
in
partnership
with
their
customers
to
grow
their
organisation
Having
recognised
the
benefits
of
operating
in
this
way
the
Starbucks
Senior
Management
Team
are
adapting
their
business
to
become
more
responsive
to
the
customers
and
to
deliver
new
experiences
with
their
customers
permission
and
inclusion
which
in
turn
makes
it
easy
for
both
starbucks
and
their
customers
to
develop
a
partnership
for
growing
the
organisation
Social
and
mobile
are
great
engagement
vehicles
which
can
support
overall
business
goals
and
as
more
organisations
learn
about
the
value
of
integrated
strategies
beyond
the
tactile
projects
more
great
examples
will
evolve

An
app
such
as
this
is
clearly
great
for
Starbucks
fans
but
many
high
street
brands
face
the
problem
that
not
everyone
has
their
app
or
necessarily
wants
it
The
real
opportunity
around
mobile
from
a
business
perspective
is
to
reach
and
convert
the
customers
that
aren
t
aware
of
or
currently
using
your
brand
the
upside
potential
of
doing
that
is
going
to
be
many
times
larger
than
preaching
to
the
converted
This
is
the
limitation
for
most
app
based
strategies
however
well
executed
they
might
be

I
would
really
like
to
try
this
but
Android
version
is
not
available
in
the
UK
as
far
as
I
can
tell
Whilst
Starbucks
are
being
very
forward
thinking
with
mobile
apps
and
payment
fully
integrated
they
are
missing
the
boat
when
it
comes
to
their
emails

at

well

What
s
the
fuss
about
Sbucks
The
Swiss
railways
have
had
all
this
and
more
for
a
while
Not
only
can
you
buy
on
line
but
the
app
updates
with
information
on
the
route
you
have
bought
a
ticket
for
as
you
travel
I
would
say
that
the
SBB
Swiss
railways
is
clearly
a
leader
etc
etc
etc
but
since
they
are
not
American
they
are
ignored

I
love
that

are

to
twitter
to
add
another
layer
of
customer
support
Just
today
I
actually
received
excellent
support
from

some

I
was

The
funny
thing
was
that
I
didn

contact
them
they
are
diligently
searching
for
mentions
of
the
brand
and
react
in
a

Love
infographics
but
what
shows
is
worrying
to
me
As
a
small
business
owner
I
am
concerned
about
unwarranted
negative
comments
going
viral
When
it
all
boils
down
to
it
we
all
make
mistakes
and
cannot
get
every
right
100
of
the
time
The
internet
and
social
media
can
be
very
unforgiving

You
are
not
alone
in
your
concerns
Especially
for
small
business
owners
it
is
extremely
challenging
finding
the
time
to
manage
your
brand
online
like
responding
to
and
managing
negative
comments
and
or
unhappy
customers
While
that
is
critical
the
bottom
line
is
that
focusing
on
delivering
a
consistent
and
delightful
customer
experience
is
still
paramount
Small
businesses
that
are
successful
in
doing
that
generally
find
that
their
most
loyal
customers
will
in
fact
often
advocate
for
their
businesses
in
social
media
forums
Or
at
least
the
positive
comments
and
reviews
will
far
outpace
any
negative
ones

Love
infographics
but
what
shows
is
worrying
to
me
As
a
small
business
owner
I
am
concerned
about
unwarranted
negative
comments
going
viral
When
it
all
boils
down
to
it
we
all
make
mistakes
and
cannot
get
every
right
100
of
the
time
The
internet
and
social
media
can
be
very
unforgiving

You
are
not
alone
in
your
concerns
Especially
for
small
business
owners
it
is
extremely
challenging
finding
the
time
to
manage
your
brand
online
like
responding
to
and
managing
negative
comments
and
or
unhappy
customers
While
that
is
critical
the
bottom
line
is
that
focusing
on
delivering
a
consistent
and
delightful
customer
experience
is
still
paramount
Small
businesses
that
are
successful
in
doing
that
generally
find
that
their
most
loyal
customers
will
in
fact
often
advocate
for
their
businesses
in
social
media
forums
Or
at
least
the
positive
comments
and
reviews
will
far
outpace
any
negative
ones

Aaron
Wall
recently
reported
on
a
Google
employee
who
left
comments
on
Hacker
News
to
the
effect
that
SEO
is
bad
for
the
internet
The
Google
employee
Googley
Jon
Rockway
said
that
SEO
isn
t
good
for
users
or
the
internet
at
large
It
s
a
surprising
statement
for
a
Google
employee
to
make
and
I
ve
been
asking
some
SEO
experts
about
their
views
on
the
issue
and
whether
this
reflects
the
search
giant
s
real
views
Here
s
Rockway
s
quote
in
more
detail
Instead
of
being
able
to
SEO
the
entire
Internet
businesses
can
now
only
affect
the
search
results
for
a
tiny
percentage
of
users
That
s
a
good
thing
because
SEO
can
t
scale
and
SEO
isn
t
good
for
users
or
the
Internet
at
large
If
you
look
at
the
Google
experience
from
the
standpoint
of
customers
it
s
pretty
good
Users
get
relevant
search
results
and
ads
Advertisers
get
their
content
on
top
of
everything
else
It
s
a
good
compromise
between
advertising
and
usability
and
it
works
really
well
It
s
a
bug
that
you
could
rank
highly
in
Google
without
buying
ads
and
Google
is
trying
to
fix
the
bug
Manipulating
Google
results
shouldn
t
be
something
you
feel
entitled
to
be
able
to
do
If
you
want
to
rank
highly
in
Google
be
relevant
for
the
user
currently
searching
Engage
him
in
social
media
or
email
provide
relevant
information
about
what
you
re
selling
and
generally
be
a
good
match
for
what
the
user
wants
What
is
the
thinking
behind
this
statement
Search
consultant
Rishi
Lakhani
feels
that
Rockway
has
gaffed
by
revealing
what
could
be
a
very
much
internal
sentiment
by
Google
on
their
stance
on
free
traffic
It
kind
of
reminds
me
of
an
old
SEO
joke
What
is
the
Meaning
of
SPAM
Search
Positions
Above
Mine
However
in
Google
s
possible
view
SPAM
could
mean
Search
Positions
Avoid
Moneymaking
Essentially
what
is
Google
s
money
making
model
Selling
Ads
Every
bit
of
free
traffic
that
a
site
receives
from
organic
search
is
a
loss
in
revenue
to
Google
So
are
you
surprised
at
this
stance
I
am
not
How
is
SEO
bad
for
internet
users
Andrew
Girdwood
Bigmouthmedia
I
have
a
lot
of
sympathy
for
Rockway
s
comment
SEO
that
attempts
to
manipulate
Google
s
or
Bing
s
search
results
so
that
less
relevant
results
are
returned
above
more
relevant
results
is
not
good
for
users
or
the
internet
I
don
t
believe
there
is
a
single
SEO
any
more
Some
of
the
SEO
throwbacks
and
perhaps
some
of
the
new
strands
do
fall
into
the
not
helpful
category
Spam
for
example
is
not
helpful
The
benefits
of
SEO
for
web
users
Yes
there
are
plenty
of
spammers
out
there
but
good
SEO
has
benefits
for
businesses
and
web
users
Here
are
just
a
few
of
those
It
has
encouraged
greater
usability
As
Site
Visibility
s
Kelvin
Newman
points
out
many
improvements
to
website
usability
have
been
made
in
order
to
optimise
for
search
engines
There
s
lots
of
annoying
aspects
of
websites
that
SEO
has
had
a
role
killing
off
I
think
the
good
Karma
for
SEO
ending
the
trend
of
splash
pages
is
enough
to
see
the
industry
through
a
decade
of
bad
behaviour
Elizabeth
Ayers
from
iCrossing
echoes
this
sentiment
If
large
quality
brands
did
not
optimise
their
sites
for
search
then
it
is
likely
that
the
web
would
be
a
poorer
place
The
web
and
social
would
not
be
as
advanced
as
it
is
today
if
SEO
hadn
t
been
such
a
key
revenue
driver
for
brands
to
take
advantage
of
and
participate
in
creating
quality
content
and
participating
on
social
platforms
It
encourages
business
to
create
better
content
Content
is
key
to
great
SEO
and
cheap
tactics
like
keyword
stuffing
just
don
t
cut
it
any
more
Instead
creating
content
that
people
want
to
read
and
share
is
what
works
best
Andrew
Girdwood
Modern
SEO
is
helpful
It
is
less
an
advertising
tactic
and
more
a
marketing
strategy
Modern
SEO
involves
creating
and
working
with
engaging
content
content
so
good
that
users
want
to
share
and
discuss
it
This
is
a
boon
for
users
and
the
net
as
it
creates
an
upwards
pressure
on
quality
It
makes
businesses
more
relevant
to
users
Rishi
Lakhani
Competitive
SEO
actually
helps
make
businesses
even
more
relevant
to
searchers
Because
we
know
who
links
naturally
and
why
A
page
full
of
carburettors
for
sale
may
not
get
links
what
is
the
motivation
But
a
page
that
shows
how
to
clean
your
carburettor
will
The
difference
between
intent
and
motivation
differs
and
it
s
the
SEO
community
that
is
hard
at
work
encouraging
such
content
SEO
is
not
bad
for
the
user
but
for
Google
s
pockets
SEO
can
help
small
businesses
to
punch
above
their
weight
There
are
businesses
spending
big
bucks
on
SEO
and
paid
search
but
by
using
solid
SEO
techniques
creating
a
usable
site
and
filling
it
with
great
content
small
businesses
can
rank
higher
than
bigger
rivals
Social
CRM
Andrew
Girdwood
A
strong
example
of
how
Modern
SEO
is
great
for
users
in
general
is
in
the
emergence
of
social
CRM
Businesses
are
increasing
their
efforts
to
look
after
customers
online
using
platforms
like
Twitter
and
Google
to
reach
out
to
people
who
have
had
a
bad
experience
with
a
brand
or
encountered
some
other
problem
This
is
in
part
due
to
the
rise
of
social
but
this
is
also
an
example
of
Modern
SEO
Google
blogged
back
in
2010
that
being
bad
to
your
customers
is
bad
for
business
Customers
benefit
whenever
brands
take
extra
effort
to
look
after
them
and
the
convergence
of
search
and
social
have
given
business
extra
incentive
to
do
just
that
Is
SEO
bad
for
Google
Is
this
the
real
subtext
of
this
statement
gaff
or
not
As
Rockway
says
thanks
to
recent
changes
such
as
Search
Plus
the
amount
of
Google
homepage
real
estate
which
is
open
to
influence
by
SEO
is
shrinking
So
is
Google
seeking
to
minimise
the
role
of
the
SEO
Rishi
Lakhani
feels
strongly
about
this
Of
course
there
are
bad
approaches
to
SEO
However
this
attitude
that
SEO
SPAM
should
stop
Because
the
biggest
violators
are
Google
themselves
It
takes
content
from
third
party
sites
and
slowly
wraps
it
up
with
ads
Google
gets
into
short
term
partnerships
with
businesses
with
an
edge
learn
their
processes
use
those
to
build
up
their
own
offering
and
then
terminate
those
relationships
Up
to
a
few
years
ago
Google
used
to
use
Yell
to
supply
local
content
Now
it
s
overtaken
by
Google
Local
For
years
Google
has
been
taking
money
from
credit
card
companies
and
comparison
sites
alike
Now
it
has
launched
its
own
version
which
it
uses
Adwords
to
push

Great
article
that
poses
a
good
question
As
an
SEO
I
get
this
question
quite
often
The
article
really
touched
on
some
good
points
One
in
particular
in
that
SEO
is
not
bad
for
the
internet
but
actually
is
good
in
that
it
improves
usability
of

Optimisation
of
social
based
algorithms
such
as
Edgerank
have
consequences
even
worse
than
what
SEO
s
have
added
or
taken
away
from
search
based
algorithm
optimisations
Social
networks
rely
on
recommendation
algorithms
that
can
be
gamed
The
worst
part
of
a
social
recommendation
algorithm
is
the
potential
to
create
an
eventual
bubble
affect
where
users
become
hugely
small
minded
and
less
about
doing
more
knowing
more
and
ceasing
to
ask
why
more
To

more

the
bubble

This
hits
it
on
the
nail
for
me
Every
bit
of
free
traffic
that
a
site
receives
from
organic
search
is
a
loss
in
revenue
to
Google
There
seems
to
have
been
a
very
different
stance
to
running
Google
with
Larry
Page
as
CEO
which
I
m
not
convinced
will
endear
users
to
Google
The
don
t
be
evil
tool
is
a
great
example
of
how
Google
have
changed
as
a
company
as
the
tool
states
the
relevancy
of
results
is
still
as
good
as
ever
however
there
s
a
different
commercial
agenda
at
Google
now
Google
are
entitled
to
run
Google
how
they
think
it
should
be
run
but
with
any
long
standing
brand
the
core
values
are
built
up
through
trust
and
awareness
over
time
Trust
is
being
eroded
away
and
what
was
once
a
fairly
clear
set
of
core
values
seems
murky
It
does
sound
like
internal
sentiment
as
to
what
Google
thinks
of
SEO
but
good
SEO
improves
the
quality
of
what
Google
returns
Its
a
WIN
WIN
for
both
Google
and
SEOs
one
cannot
work
without
the
other
especially
since
the
Google
signals
rely
on
proper
website
structure
which
the
majority
of
SEOs
have
helped
develop
over
the
last
decade
This
article
still
rings
true
for
the
2
areas
where
google
may
slip
up
quality
of
results
and
overdoing
the
social
drive

flavours
of
SEO
some
more
oily
than
others
but
for
many
organisations
SEO
is
an
essential
part
of
running
a
business
online
The
goals
of
SEO
should
simply
be
to
improve
editorial
and
technical
quality
not
to
mention
competitiveness
which
results
in
a
better
UX
all
round
Without
SEOs
who
helps
raise
the
editorial
bar
many
journalists
still
neglect
copy
that
they
believe
is
invisible
who
ensures
that
slavishly
produced
content
is
optimised
to
the
people
that
are
looking
for
it
most
who
checks
for
damaging
site
errors
very
often
people
who
should
have
clocked
them
have
not
who
ensures
pages
are
coded
to
proper
standards
so
that
they
are
discoverable
in
search
While
you
could
nominate
other
company
roles
to
all
of
the
above
truth
is
most
of
the
time
they
re
just
cleaning
up
someone
else
s
mess
So
really
SEO
done
the
right
way
is
about
improving
the
web
not
ruining
it

Hi
Graham
I
think
this
is
a
timely
article
SEO
is
not
inherently
bad
diluting
quality
is
Some
of
what
Rockway
said
is
bang
on
the
money
if
you
want
to
rank
highly
in
Google
be
relevant
for
the
user
currently
searching
However
he
positions
his
opinion
poorly
Positive
SEO
is
about
being
relevant
if
you
re
not
relevant
you
ll
just
get
poor
metrics
and
people
won
t
come
back
I
think
Rishi
s
last
comment
is
quite
interesting
Google
taking
3rd
party
content
and
wrapping
it
with
ads
It
s
all
about
the
money
to
them
I
don
t
believe
anymore
that
the
focus
is
on
the
user
The
focus
is
on
driving
revenue
and
they
have
to
think
about
the
user
to
achieve
that
SEO
is
an
innate
thing
it
can
t
be
bad
it
s
the
people
behind
it
that
are
choosing
whether
or
not
to
follow
good
or
bad
practice
So
let
s
focus
praise
and
criticism
on
the
people
doing
not
a
marketing
discipline
thanks

encouraging

helping

be

I
feel
this
Googler
slipped
up
on
his
choice
of
wording
about
SEO
His
opinion
harks
back
to
the
stigma
associated
with
SEO
of
5
years
ago
back
then
SEO
was
regarded
as
trying
to
outsmart
Google
by
looking
for
loopholes
People
did
exploit
these
methods
until
they
were
closed
off
but
sites
that
were
ranking
falsely
genuinely
didn
t
add
to
the
user
experience
Many
of
these
websites
were
affiliate
sites
or
sites
littered
with
adverts
SEO
s
should
be
working
toward
consumer
centric
SEO
This
means
only
optimising
websites
in
ways
that
will
enhance
the
user
s
experience
They
can
do
using
content
rich
campaigns
and
techniques
that
help
users
find
useful
information
easily
White
hat
SEO
s
should
be
working
in
the
best
interest
of
everyone
the
user
the
site
owner
AND
the
search
engines
Google
is
embracing
SEO
regardless
of
what
this
employee
says
e
g
Google
s
Search
Engine
Optimization
Starter
Guide
Developments
in
webmaster
tools
also
encourage
site
owners
to
make
changes
to
their
website
so
that
Google
can
crawl
it
more
efficiently
and
help
it
understand
what
their
site
is
about
SEO
s
should
be
working
to
help
Google
in
its
plight
for
high
quality
relevant
search
results
not
fighting
against
it
to
warp
the
results
for
profit
While
we
disagree
that
SEO
is
bad
for
the
internet
we
do
agree
however
that
black
hat
SEO
is
bad
for
the
user
and
everyone
in
the
long
run
A
good
post

interesting

Google

real

There
are
now

more
social

according
to

99

If
there
was
no
SEO
good
sites
would
naturally
rise
to
the
top
of
the
rankings
because
people
would
link
to
them
SEOs
running
link
building
campaigns
skew
this
data
by
creating
hundreds
of
links
to
content
which
people
would
otherwise
not
be
interested
in
reading
Some
SEOs
resort
to
posting
links
on
unprotected
forums
and
comment
threads
Harm
clearly
is
done
in

Nicholas
if
you
have
search
engines
you
have
SEO
The
two
are
inseparable
The
search
engines
have
to
decide
a
method
by
which
sites
are
ranked
highest
and
website
owners
and
marketers
want
to
figure
out
how
and
improve
their
own
rankings
With
modern
SEO
as
Andrew
Girdwood
calls
it
you
have
more
user
friendly
websites
which
have
to
create
content
that
is
interesting
and
relevant
to
the
searcher
This
benefits

I
think
this
is
a
bit
of
a
red
herring
In
general
SEO
has
always
benefited
Google
they
ve
simply
tried
to
blacken
the
areas
that
risked
devaluing
their
algorithm
At
the
moment
they
re
in
the
middle
of
tweaking
the
rules
considerably
so
that
SEO
benefits
them
even
further
As
one
example
they
re
dangling
the
carrot
of
more
traffic
for
website
owners
to
buy
into
the
Google
SPYW
stuff
In
doing
so
they
hope
this
will
help
to
drag
the
mainstream
across
And
of
course
if
that
all
works
out
they
win
twice
once
for
the
social
network
element
of
Google
once
for
embedding
themselves
as
a
large
downstream
recipient

This
is
a
curious
debate
thread
although
I
agree
with
Rishi
s
reasoning
Google
Apple
Microsoft
are
run
by
shareholders
and
accountants
Data
is
a
valuable
resource
and
to
expect
a
private
company
to
actively
support
ventures
that
threaten
income
streams
may
be
a
little
short
sighted
Facebook
backed
by
Goldman
Sachs
is
floating
soon
is
it
any
wonder
that
Google
is
looking
at
giving
less
away
and
developing
and
tightening
up
its
core
business
restrictions
of
keyword
data
normalisation
of
personal
records
across
accounts
google
In
a
few
years
time
its
possible
that
people
will
look
back
at
this
period
and
be
amazed
that
you
could
get
free
traffic
free
data
and
build
successful
businesses
without
investing
all
that
heavily

Yeah
Google
thinks
it
s
bad
cause
they
don
t
earn
money
from
good
natural
SEO
A
search
engine
without
natural
results
is
probably
their
ideal
I
imagine
the
Yellow
Pages
came
up
with
an
idea
pre
internet
to
charge
consumers
for
their
directories
as
well
as
businesses

This
is
ridiculous
For
someone
to
say
that
Optimising
a
website
for
a
Search
Engine
is
bad
for
the
internet
would
logically
imply
that
there
s
something
wrong
with
the

itself

I
presume
he
s
referring
to
old
style
SEO
where
links
are
bought
or
other
shady
practices
are
used
to
push
rankings
artificially
high
That
is
bad
for
users
But
Authentic
Search
where
quality
content
is
provided
on
site
to
match
what
users
are
looking
for
and
promoted
off
site
through
quality
free
editorial
is
clearly
very
good
for
users

How
about
this
for
discussion
Realistically
we
should
in
the
long
term
consider
any
traffic
received
from
Google
for
free
as
a
gift
and
plan
for
what
is
no
doubt
coming
down
the
line
if
you
make
money
from
Google
traffic
expect
them
to
take
a
cut
unless
you
have
done
something
remarkable
to
earn
it
Were
we
talking
about
physical
property
the
discussion
would
be
very
different
Were
Google
a
shopping
centre
with
a
90
share
of
footfall
we
d
laugh
at
the
idea
of
letting
traders
set
up
stalls
and
sell
for
free
whilst
at
the
same
time
charging
other
tenants
for
their
space
We
d
think
it
hilarious
that
we
could
use
sometimes
dubious
techniques
to
corral
shoppers
to
our
stand
perhaps
we
d
put
up
barriers
and
PVC
banners
outside
a
paying
tenant
s
shop
diverting
people
Can
you
imagine
Looking
for
a
Cheap
Mobile
Phone
Come
to
our
cheap
mobile
phone
stand
for
cheap
mobile
deals
etc
etc
We
d
be
bent
over
double
at
the
entreaties
from
retailers
who
consider
themselves
ethical
and
who
claim
to
provide
what
customers
are
looking
for
yet
want
to
make
a
profit
for
themselves
without
paying
rent
to
the
shopping
centre
regardless
of
the
information
they
provide
to
users
at
the
stand
or
the
special
free
guides
Getting
the
most
from
your
organic
eggs
naturally
written
by
an
organic
egg
guru
they
give
away
to
everyone
willing
to
hand
over
their
mobile
phone
number
or
email
address
Yet
this
is
the
freedom
we
all
expect
from

This
post
highlights
a
simple
useful
feature
that
s
crept
onto
most
of
the
UK
s
largest
e
commerce
sites
over
the
last
couple
of
years
with
no
real
coverage
The
promo
strip
is
not
new
but
has
slowly
caught
on
to
the
point
it
s
almost
standard
for
high
street
retailers
yet
still
fairly
rare
on
smaller
sites
It
s
a
very
useful
addition
from
both
the
customer
perspective
quickly
informative
without
being
overbearing
and
from
the
brand
perspective
conversion
orientated
without
being
overbearing
There
are
12
examples
below
including
variations
on
the
central
idea
The
Promo
Strip
Here
s
an
example
of
the
most
basic
version
from
Play
com
That
s
it
A
simple
strip
of
key
information
that
appears
under
the
top
navigation
of
a
site
performing
a
roughly
similar
function
as
a
direct
mail
Johnson
Box
Sometimes
these
promote
key
selling
points
of
the
site
or
the
brand
itself
other
times
they
highlight
current
promotions
though
really
they
re
a
nice
way
to
display
info
that
you
want
every

John

There
s
a
theme
among
the
biggest
retailers
to
use
the
strip
for
delivery
messaging
John

here
Debenhams
And
again
Debenhams
follows
along
with

Interesting
variations
on
the
theme
Other
than
the
standard
free
delivery
over
XX
pick
up
in
store
here
are
a
few
variations
from
retailers
who
ve
gone
a
little
further
Marks
Spencer
M
S
step
things
up
nicely
from
their
competitors
showing
international
and
UK
delivery
info
but
also
highlighting
current
promotions
in
an
area
every
site
visitor
will
see
M
S
almost
always
has
sales
on
some
areas
of
the
site
and
this
allows
the
retailer
to
flag
these
to
everyone
who
lands
on
the
site
Boux
Avenue
Another
retailer
showing
their
delivery
and
returns
info
but
Boux
Avenue
is
worth
a
mention
as
whereas
other
retailers
have
lumped
the
promo
strip
on
top
of
their
existing
design
Boux
have
folded
it
very
neatly
in
with
the
overall
look
theme
of
the
site
Naked
Wines
Naked
s
version
differs
slightly
from
others
Firstly
it
s
above
the
navigation
Secondly
it
introduces
some
urgency
and
a
deadline
with
their
Order
in
the
next
XX
minutes
for
next
day
delivery
call
to
action
Penhaligon
s
Penhaligon
s
fill
this
area
of
dead
space
in
its
layout
with
free
delivery
info
but
also
very
usefully
for
a
heavily
gifted
brand
promotes
its
free
gift
wrapping
service
here
Pen
Heaven
As
with
Naked
Wines
Pen
Heaven
again
focuses
on
urgency
offering
same
day
engraving
for
orders
before
a
particular
time
It
also
features
customer
reviews
heavily
here
great
for
a
smaller
brand
that
visitors
may
not
have
heard
of
Kiddicare
Kiddicare
is
probably
the
UK
s
leading
baby
product
website
it
also
leads
the
way
here
with
its
promo
strip
First
it
beats
out
all
of
the
standard
delivery
promos
with
next
day
delivery
in
1
hour
slots
Second
it
shows
off
the
365
day
return
policy
Third
Kiddicare
offers
a
price
match
promise
Taking
it
far
further
the
retailer
has
added
these
strips
down
either
side
of
the
main
content
These
strips
are
hidden
if
you
re
on
a
smaller
resolution
eg
1024x768
For
anyone
on
a
larger
monitor
they
reinforce
the
price
match
fast
despatch
but
also
show
off
their
many
awards
and
promote
their
119
000
product
reviews
Summary
As
you
can
see
these
have
popped
up
all
over
the
place
They
re
a
very
simple
addition
to
highlight
features
or
info
you
want
to
show
off
to
all
of
your
visitors
If
you
run
an
e
commerce
site
and
haven
t
already
tried
this
it
s
worth
testing
If
you
re
already
running
this
with
the
bog
standard
free
delivery
over
xx
it
s
worth
trialing
some
other
ideas
to
see
the
impact
they
have
There
are
some
nice
extensions
to
this
too
personalising
them
to
include
discount
codes
depending
on
traffic
source
etc
If
you
re
willing
to
A
B
test
it
it
s
probably
worth
paying
more
attention
to
the
impact
it
has
on
new
visitors
or
first
time
buyers
rather
than
your
overall
conversion
rate

other

Great
article
Dan
highlighting
something
which
I
have
been
talking
about
and
presenting
ideas
on
over
the
last
12
months
The
promo
strip
is
a
great
example
of
a
design
pattern
which
I
am
seeing
users
actively
engage
with
during
user
testing
sessions
Your
summary
of
the
benefits
of
this
feature
is
spot
on
too
It
s
a
very
useful
addition
from
both
the
customer
perspective
quickly
informative
without
being
overbearing
and
from
the
brand
perspective
conversion
orientated
without
being
overbearing
Picking
up
on
the
Naked
Wines
example
you
have
provided
they
have
in
fact
featured
this
countdown
timer
since
they
launched
their
site
and
its
a
superb
way
to
deliver
a
persuasive
technique
creating
a
sense
of
urgency
to
which
you
can
almost
guarantee
all
site
visitors
will
see
even
if
only
sub
consciously
A
quick
recommendation
I
make
to
retailers
when
they
are
implementing
these
strips
is
to
not
try
cramming
too
many
messages
in
the
space
If
you
compare
John
Lewis
to
Pen
Heaven
or
Kiddicare
it
takes
less
effort
to
scan
the
latter
two
sites
messages
along
with
them
using
visual
elements
to
help
differentiate
the
messages

a
great

Thanks
Paul
And
great
advice
Interestingly
I
don
t
think
the
Naked
Wines
design
had
it
from
the
start
I
could
be
wrong
but
I
think
this
was
their
original
http
bit
ly
originalnw
I
think
that
makes
a
nice
point
too
it
s
really
useful
to
test
this
kind
of
thing
to
find
out
what
works
for
your
site
your
audience
and
your
business
needs

Agree
on
your
point
that
its
been
quietly
bubbling
away
on
many
e
com
sites
without
too
much
focus
Very
useful
when
used
in
the
right
way
One
thing
I
ve
not
seen
is
contextualising
and
personalising
this
area
there
are
pros
and
cons
associated
with
this
but
used
correctly
you
could
use
profile
data
on
the
user
ie
first
visit
categories
browsed
etc
to
provide
some
persuasive
prompting
e
g
for
a
first
time
visitor
provide
generic
deliver
returns
click
collect
etc
info
and
start
tailoring
the
message
as
a
visitor
moves
from
first
time
to
a
potential
customer
to
becoming
a
customer
etc
and
then
within
things
that
fit
your
brand
such
as
male
female
like
the
M
S
example
simply
choosing
whether
to
display
the
Men
s
or
Women
s
Trouser
Offer

They
are
fantastic
examples
of
persuading
the
user
without
bombarding
them
with
too
much
information
I
couldn
t
agree
more
with
Paul
about
the
scanning
the
messages
How
adding
a
bit
of
colour
to
break
the
different
messages
down
alongside
more
leading
text
Another
great
example
of
this
is
ASOS
they
really
are
fantastic
and
persuading
through
out
the
customer
journey

Interesting
to
see
so
many
retailers
using
the
bar
to
promote
their
delivery
offerings
Perhaps
it
s
because
most
of
their
customers
are
familiar
with
their
wider
propositions
so
they
don
t
need
to
push
the
why
choose
us
message
I
d
advocate
using
the
bar
to
push
the
key
USPs
for
the
business
particularly
for
smaller
less
well
known
retailers
fighting
to
make
their
mark
It
would
be
interesting
to
see
eye
tracking
studies
or
survey
people
using
sites
featuring
promo
bars
to
see
if
the
content
registers
with
them
or
not
Given
that
the
bar
is
likely
to
be
in
their
eyeline
as
they
journey
through
the
site
I
d
wager
that
it
registers
subconsciously
even
if
they
dont
actively
read
it

Very
interesting
indeed
Thanks
Dan
I
think
it
s
very
good
when
patterns
like
these
start
to
emerge
As
with
top
navigation
and
side
navigation
or
email
address
then
password
for
login
as
an
even
more
common
one
it
helps
if
new
visitors
have
some
expectation
of
where
some
things
may
be
I
agree
with
Albie
that
the
why
choose
us
message
is
very
important
too
Not
one
of
these
examples
does
much
along
those
lines
I
think
they
re
assuming
everyone
will
recognise
them
which
is
no
longer
a
safe
bet
But
in
fact
I
think
a
USP
message
need
to
be
bigger
and
more
prominent
than
these
strips
One
question
for
Paul
you
mention
people
engaging
with
these
strips
in
usability
tests
Was
that
just
mentioning
them
in
think
out
loud
or
actually
clicking
please
I
m
reassured
either
way
because
all
too
often
I
find
people
manage
to
miss
even
prominent
messages
But
I
m
also
slightly
concerned
if
someone
s
first
reaction
when
landing
on
a
site
was
to
click
for
details
on
something
like
this
even
if
it
does
demonstrate
a
keen
commercial
intent

In
most
instances
it
was
displayed
on
the
main
page
and
as
the
writer
pointed
out
it
can
appear
on
all
pages
I
believe
it
could
be
very
useful
as
it
is
an
upsell
on
the
checkout
page
opinion
It
distracts
from
the
natural
flow
of
the
menu
and
home
page
flow
and
would
cause
most
consumers
to
pause
just
long
enough
to
wonder
why
they
are
there
and
leave
A
more
interesting
study
Albie
would
be
a
correlation
between
eye
tracking
and
conversion
rates
as
while
I
certainly
agree
it
s
a
great
idea
it
s
the
type
of
distraction
that
can
potentially
loose
a
customer
if
over
used
It
would
be
unusual
that
something
like
this
would
have
been
incorporated
into
the
original
design
of
the
site
and
as
such
adding
it
afterwords
without
breaking
up
the
natural
flow
of
the
original
design
would
be
difficult
I
think
it
s
an
excellent
way
to
drawer
additional
value
to
your
site
but
only
if
used
in
moderation
and
where
a
customer
might
naturally
expect
to
see
it
Very
nice
article

I
ve
done
some
research
around
this
area
and
have
started
to
call
them
confidence
banners
since
they
often
don
t
aim
to
directly
convert
with
a
call
to
action
merely
instill
confidence
in
the
customer

This
post
highlights
a
simple
useful
feature
that
s
crept
onto
most
of
the
UK
s
largest
e
commerce
sites
over
the
last
couple
of
years
with
no
real
coverage
The
promo
strip
is
not
new
but
has
slowly
caught
on
to
the
point
it
s
almost
standard
for
high
street
retailers
yet
still
fairly
rare
on
smaller
sites
It
s
a
very
useful
addition
from
both
the
customer
perspective
quickly
informative
without
being
overbearing
and
from
the
brand
perspective
conversion
orientated
without
being
overbearing
There
are
12
examples
below
including
variations
on
the
central
idea
The
Promo
Strip
Here
s
an
example
of
the
most
basic
version
from
Play
com
That
s
it
A
simple
strip
of
key
information
that
appears
under
the
top
navigation
of
a
site
performing
a
roughly
similar
function
as
a
direct
mail
Johnson
Box
Sometimes
these
promote
key
selling
points
of
the
site
or
the
brand
itself
other
times
they
highlight
current
promotions
though
really
they
re
a
nice
way
to
display
info
that
you
want
every
visitor
to
the
site
to
see
The
benefits
of
placing
these
under
the
top
navigation
are
They
appear
on
every
page
so
no
matter
where
someone
lands
on
the
site
they
see
it
Even
if
visitors
are
on
a
low
screen
resolution
they
still
see
it
immediately
The
top
navigation
is
where
visitors
are
looking
so
whether
they
register
it
consciously
or
not
almost
everyone
sees
it
11
More
Examples
Below
are
11
more
examples
of
the
trend
In
each
screengrab
the
promo
strip
is
highlighted
in
green
John
Lewis
There
s
a
theme
among
the
biggest
retailers
to
use
the
strip
for
delivery
messaging
John
Lewis
promote
their
free
delivery
threshold
their
click
to
collect
international
delivery
info
along
with
their
famous
Never
Knowingly
Undersold
Evans
Evans
follow
the
trend
with

information
but
also
include
a
call
to
action
to
sign
up
to
their
email
list
Topshop
Again
Topshop

for
the
Free
UK
Delivery
an
international

House

John
Lewis
or
maybe
it
was
the
other
way
round
with
store
collection
free
delivery
and
international
delivery
all
promoted
prominently
here
Debenhams
And
again
Debenhams
follows
along
with
Free
Delivery
store
collection
and
international
delivery
Interesting
variations
on
the
theme
Other
than
the
standard
free
delivery
over
XX
pick
up
in
store
here
are
a
few
variations
from
retailers
who
ve
gone
a
little
further
Marks
Spencer
M
S
step
things
up
nicely
from
their
competitors
showing
international
and
UK
delivery
info
but
also
highlighting
current
promotions
in
an
area
every
site
visitor
will
see
M
S
almost
always
has
sales
on
some
areas
of
the
site
and
this
allows
the
retailer
to
flag
these
to
everyone
who
lands
on
the
site
Boux
Avenue
Another
retailer
showing
their
delivery
and
returns
info
but
Boux
Avenue
is
worth
a
mention
as
whereas
other
retailers
have
lumped
the
promo
strip
on
top
of
their
existing
design
Boux
have
folded
it
very
neatly
in
with
the
overall
look
theme
of
the
site
Naked
Wines
Naked
s
version
differs
slightly
from
others
Firstly
it
s
above
the
navigation
Secondly
it
introduces
some
urgency
and
a
deadline
with
their
Order
in
the
next
XX
minutes
for
next
day
delivery
call
to
action
Penhaligon
s
Penhaligon
s
fill
this
area
of
dead
space
in
its
layout
with
free
delivery
info
but
also
very
usefully
for
a
heavily
gifted
brand
promotes
its
free
gift
wrapping
service
here
Pen
Heaven
As
with
Naked
Wines
Pen
Heaven
again
focuses
on
urgency
offering
same
day
engraving
for
orders
before
a
particular
time
It
also
features
customer
reviews
heavily
here
great
for
a
smaller
brand
that
visitors
may
not
have
heard
of
Kiddicare
Kiddicare
is
probably
the
UK
s
leading
baby
product
website
it
also
leads
the
way
here
with
its
promo
strip
First
it
beats
out
all
of
the
standard
delivery
promos
with
next
day
delivery
in
1
hour
slots
Second
it
shows
off
the
365
day
return
policy
Third
Kiddicare
offers
a
price
match
promise
Taking
it
far
further
the
retailer
has
added
these
strips
down
either
side
of
the
main
content
These
strips
are
hidden
if
you
re
on
a
smaller
resolution
eg
1024x768
For
anyone
on
a
larger
monitor
they
reinforce
the
price
match
fast
despatch
but
also
show
off
their
many
awards
and
promote
their
119
000
product
reviews
Summary
As
you
can
see
these
have
popped
up
all
over
the
place
They
re
a
very
simple
addition
to
highlight
features
or
info
you
want
to
show
off
to
all
of
your
visitors
If
you
run
an
e
commerce
site
and
haven
t
already
tried
this
it
s
worth
testing
If
you
re
already
running
this
with
the
bog
standard
free
delivery
over
xx
it
s
worth
trialing
some
other
ideas
to
see
the
impact
they
have
There
are
some
nice
extensions
to
this
too
personalising
them
to
include
discount
codes
depending
on
traffic
source
etc
If
you
re
willing
to
A
B
test
it
it
s
probably
worth
paying
more
attention
to
the
impact
it
has
on
new
visitors
or
first
time
buyers
rather
than
your
overall
conversion
rate

other
interesting
examples

Great
article
Dan
highlighting
something
which
I
have
been
talking
about
and
presenting
ideas
on
over
the
last
12
months
The
promo
strip
is
a
great
example
of
a
design
pattern
which
I
am
seeing
users
actively
engage
with
during
user
testing
sessions
Your
summary
of
the
benefits
of
this
feature
is
spot
on
too
It
s
a
very
useful
addition
from
both
the
customer
perspective
quickly
informative
without
being
overbearing
and
from
the
brand
perspective
conversion
orientated
without
being
overbearing
Picking
up
on
the
Naked
Wines
example
you
have
provided
they
have
in
fact
featured
this
countdown
timer
since
they
launched
their
site
and
its
a
superb
way
to
deliver
a
persuasive
technique
creating
a
sense
of
urgency
to
which
you
can
almost
guarantee
all
site
visitors
will
see
even
if
only
sub
consciously
A
quick
recommendation
I
make
to
retailers
when
they
are
implementing
these
strips
is
to
not
try
cramming
too
many
messages
in
the
space
If
you
compare
John
Lewis
to
Pen
Heaven
or
Kiddicare
it
takes
less
effort
to
scan
the
latter
two
sites
messages
along
with
them
using
visual
elements
to
help
differentiate
the
messages
Thanks
again
for
a
great

Thanks
Paul
And
great
advice
Interestingly
I
don
t
think
the
Naked
Wines
design
had
it
from
the
start
I
could
be
wrong
but
I
think
this
was
their
original
http
bit
ly
originalnw
I
think
that
makes
a
nice
point
too
it
s
really
useful
to
test
this
kind
of
thing
to
find
out
what
works
for
your
site
your
audience
and
your
business
needs

again

Agree
on
your
point
that
its
been
quietly
bubbling
away
on
many
e
com
sites
without
too
much
focus
Very
useful
when
used
in
the
right
way
One
thing
I
ve
not
seen
is
contextualising
and
personalising
this
area
there
are
pros
and
cons
associated
with
this
but
used
correctly
you
could
use
profile
data
on
the
user
ie
first
visit
categories
browsed
etc
to
provide
some
persuasive
prompting
e
g
for
a
first
time
visitor
provide
generic
deliver
returns
click
collect
etc
info
and
start
tailoring
the
message
as
a
visitor
moves
from
first
time
to
a
potential
customer
to
becoming
a
customer
etc
and
then
within
things
that
fit
your
brand
such
as
male
female
like
the
M
S
example
simply
choosing
whether
to
display
the
Men
s
or
Women
s
Trouser
Offer

Great
article

They
are
fantastic
examples
of
persuading
the
user
without
bombarding
them
with
too
much
information
I
couldn
t
agree
more
with
Paul
about
the
scanning
the
messages
How
adding
a
bit
of
colour
to
break
the
different
messages
down
alongside
more
leading
text
Another
great
example
of
this
is
ASOS
they
really
are
fantastic
and
persuading
through
out
the
customer
journey

Interesting
to
see
so
many
retailers
using
the
bar
to
promote
their
delivery
offerings
Perhaps
it
s
because
most
of
their
customers
are
familiar
with
their
wider
propositions
so
they
don
t
need
to
push
the
why
choose
us
message
I
d
advocate
using
the
bar
to
push
the
key
USPs
for
the
business
particularly
for
smaller
less
well
known
retailers
fighting
to
make
their
mark
It
would
be
interesting
to
see
eye
tracking
studies
or
survey
people
using
sites
featuring
promo
bars
to
see
if
the
content
registers
with
them
or
not
Given
that
the
bar
is
likely
to
be
in
their
eyeline
as
they
journey
through
the
site
I
d
wager
that
it
registers
subconsciously
even
if
they
dont
actively
read
it

Very
interesting
indeed
Thanks
Dan
I
think
it
s
very
good
when
patterns
like
these
start
to
emerge
As
with
top
navigation
and
side
navigation
or
email
address
then
password
for
login
as
an
even
more
common
one
it
helps
if
new
visitors
have
some
expectation
of
where
some
things
may
be
I
agree
with
Albie
that
the
why
choose
us
message
is
very
important
too
Not
one
of
these
examples
does
much
along
those
lines
I
think
they
re
assuming
everyone
will
recognise
them
which
is
no
longer
a
safe
bet
But
in
fact
I
think
a
USP
message
need
to
be
bigger
and
more
prominent
than
these
strips
One
question
for
Paul
you
mention
people
engaging
with
these
strips
in
usability
tests
Was
that
just
mentioning
them
in
think
out
loud
or
actually
clicking
please
I
m
reassured
either
way
because
all
too
often
I
find
people
manage
to
miss
even
prominent
messages
But
I
m
also
slightly
concerned
if
someone
s
first
reaction
when
landing
on
a
site
was
to
click
for
details
on
something
like
this
even
if
it
does
demonstrate
a
keen
commercial
intent

In
most
instances
it
was
displayed
on
the
main
page
and
as
the
writer
pointed
out
it
can
appear
on
all
pages
I
believe
it
could
be
very
useful
as
it
is
an
upsell
on
the
checkout
page
opinion
It
distracts
from
the
natural
flow
of
the
menu
and
home
page
flow
and
would
cause
most
consumers
to
pause
just
long
enough
to
wonder
why
they
are
there
and
leave
A
more
interesting
study
Albie
would
be
a
correlation
between
eye
tracking
and
conversion
rates
as
while
I
certainly
agree
it
s
a
great
idea
it
s
the
type
of
distraction
that
can
potentially
loose
a
customer
if
over
used
It
would
be
unusual
that
something
like
this
would
have
been
incorporated
into
the
original
design
of
the
site
and
as
such
adding
it
afterwords
without
breaking
up
the
natural
flow
of
the
original
design
would
be
difficult
I
think
it
s
an
excellent
way
to
drawer
additional
value
to
your
site
but
only
if
used
in
moderation
and
where
a
customer
might
naturally
expect
to
see
it
Very
nice
article

I
ve
done
some
research
around
this
area
and
have
started
to
call
them
confidence
banners
since
they
often
don
t
aim
to
directly
convert
with
a
call
to
action
merely
instill
confidence
in
the
customer
making
them
more

make
a

Domino
s
Pizza
UK
Ireland
has
revealed
that
13
of
its
digital
sales
come
through
a
tablet
or
smartphone
These
stats
were
released
today
as
the
company
also
launched
a
Windows
7
version
of
its
mobile
app
the
seventh
channel
that
s
now
available
for
mobile
sales
Mobile
has
proved
to
be
a
hugely
successful
avenue
for
Domino
s
the
company
s
iPhone
app
alone
has
generated
over
10m
in
sales
in
the
past
year
and
now
accounts
for
4
1
of
all
online
orders
Domino
s
head
of
commercial
systems
Paul
Francis
says
that
the
brand
lends
itself
brilliantly
to
mobile
retail
13
of
all
digital
sales
come
though
a
tablet
or
smartphone
so
we
know
that
for
many
customers
mobile
is
the
preferred
way
of
ordering
We
have
ambitious
plans
for
2012
and
I
am
delighted
that
we
can
offer
this
new
app
for
the
Windows
Phone
7
platform
We
look
forward
to
hearing
what
our
customers
think
Whereas
Domino
s
multimedia
manager
Nick
Dutch
highlighted
that
this
new
app
release
built
by
Vexed
Digital
is
a
response
to
developing
consumer
trends
and
staying
ahead
of
the
game
With
WP7
we
see
a
great
opportunity
to
get
into
the
hands
of
loyal
Nokia
fans
who
will
be
upgrading
as
WP7
launches
Back
in
September
we
reviewed
Domino
s
iPad
app
which
to
this
day
provides
a
significant
advantage
for
the
company
over
its
main
rival
Pizza
Hut
which
has
not
done
anything
with
mobile
at
all
in
the
UK
at
least
Like
the
iPhone
version
the
iPad
app
developed
by
Somo
is
well
designed
and
intuitive
to
use
and
the
larger
screen
allows
it
to
use
high
resolution
images
of
its
pizzas
The
brand
also
released
a
second
app
in
the
app
in
the
US
in
November
Named
Pizza
Hero
it
s
a
game
format
that
times
how
long
it
takes
for
you
to
virtually
top
a
pizza
with
points
awarded
for
performance
Once
you
ve
passed
levels
one
through
five
affectionately
nicknamed
Pizza
School
other
players
will
get
a
chance
to
rate
your
performance
Players
can
then
of
course
order
a
real
delivery
through
the
app
Domino
s
also
announced
today
that
it
was
reviewing
its
digital
and
direct
marketing
account
A
large
proportion
of
Domino
s
marketing
budget
is
spent
on
digital
advertising
with
nearly
half
of
its
pizza
sales
now
made
online

Having
made
it
to
the
shortlist
for
the
2012
Econsultancy
Innovation
Awards
it
s
fair
to
say
the
people
we
ve
been
interviewing
this
week
know
a
thing
or
two
about
bright
ideas
Today
we
asked
them
to
cast
an
eye
back
over
the
last
twelve
months
and
identify
the
innovations
they
feel
have
had
the
biggest
effect
on
the
marketing
landscape
Of
course
hindsight
is
always
20
20
so
we
also
challenged
them
to
gaze
ahead
and
offer
their
opinions
on
the
trends
to
watch
in
2012
Unsurprisingly
there
was
a
lot
of
crossover
with
mobile
video
and
social
technologies
all
emerging
as
consistent
trends
to
watch
While
some
technologies
are
still
in
their
infancy
savvy
marketers
are
starting
to
experiment
with
new
channels
as
soon
as
the
opportunity
presents
itself
The
expanding
mobile
market
The
Year
of
Mobile
may
have
been
repeated
to
the
point
of
clich
but
many
contributors
felt
that
2011
was
the
year
when
mobile
devices
became
ubiquitous
Concerns
about
multichannel
attribution
finally
became
a
reality
for
marketers
while
optimisation
and
platform
relevance
would
increase
in
importance
going
forward
Nishma
Robb
Business
Development
Marketing
Director
at
I
Spy
Marketing
summed
this
up
nicely
In
2011
we
were
told
that
it
was
the
year
of
mobile
although
we
at
I
Spy
thought
that
it
was
the
year
of
the
smartphone
This
year
we
think
that
it
will
be
the
year
of
multichannel
integration
on
smartphones
While
many
others
commented
on
the
expected
expansion
of
the
market
in
2012
Maani
Safa
Innovation
Director
at
Somo
talked
about
the
role
of
tablets
Looking
ahead
I
believe
there
will
be
an
explosion
in
tablet
first
applications
To
date
the
mobile
space
has
predominantly
focused
on
consumer
markets
In
the
year
ahead
I
am
particularly
interested
in
how
mobile
and
tablet
devices
can
be
put
to
use
within
the
enterprise
Jonathan
Horden
MD
COO
at
PrismaStar
The
rise
of
the
tablet
whether
it
s
Apple
s
iPad
or
Amazon
s
Kindle
innovation
in
tablet
technology
has
been
phenomenal
in
2011
and
has
now
bridged
the
gap
from
early
adopter
to
main
stream
technology
must
have
Could
these
be
the
death
of
the
laptop
More
efficient
data
tracking
and
use
Jonathan
also
felt
that
understanding
the
data
setsprovided
by
multiple
devices
would
be
key
to
success
in
the
future
a
view
echoed
by
a
number
of
those
we
interviewed
The
biggest
trend
has
to
be
convergence
creating
a
unified
online
experience
across
whatever
channel
the
consumer
wants
to
interact
with
the
ability
to
transfer
that
experience
to
any
other
media
This
includes
mobile
phones
tablets
the
PC
at
work
the
laptop
at
home
calls
to
telesales
or
customer
services
and
any
in
store
experience
A
shopper
can
browse
for
products
on
our
in
store
kiosks
transfer
results
to
his
home
PC
or
mobile
device
complete
the
transaction
with
a
telesales
operative
or
any
combination
of
the
above
The
entire
experience
is
consistent
and
integrated
across
all
channels
Chris
Ward
European
MD
at
Kenshoo
and
HSBC
Expat
s
Head
of
Marketing
Lisa
Wood
also
felt
strongly
about
this
Chris
Ward
I
think
the
biggest
trend
for
2012
will
be
consolidation
With
multiple
new
channels
emerging
marketers
will
want
to
consolidate
all
their
activity
on
one
platform
dashboard
It
has
become
even
more
important
now
to
be
able
to
see
the
larger
picture
and
understand
how
all
the
different
marketing
activities
tie
in
together
to
help
achieve
a
goal
Lisa
Wood
Increasingly
businesses
also
need
to
view
and
manage
all
their
digital
activity
in
the
wider
context
of
the
digital
marketing
ecosystem
Everything
is
interconnected
Paid
media
can
launch
a
viral
campaign
based
on
owned
content
generating
earned
media
conversations
and
links
which
drive
traffic
improve
search
engine
rankings
and
ultimately
save
money
in
paid
media
ads
that
can
be
reinvested
Overlaying
this
will
be
the
need
for
one
analytics
package
that
allows
businesses
to
see
the
effects
of
digital
marketing
efforts
across
the
ecosystem
and
ultimately
compare
ROI
of
paid
owned
and
earned
media
using
a
common
set
of
metrics
The
importance
of
video
Lisa
was
one
of
many
who
believed
in
the
growing
importance
of
video
next
year
despite
the
problems
presented
by
multiple
platform
deployment
In
addition
many
believe
that
TV
will
once
more
move
to
the
forefront
for
advertisers
thanks
to
connected
technologies
and
increased
integration
Lisa
explains
Google
TV
was
probably
inevitable
but
the
fact
that
you
can
now
use
your
mobile
as
a
remote
control
for
your
TV
when
you
re
on
the
move
is
a
great
innovation
Increasingly
I
think
we
ll
see
mobile
devices
being
able
to
control
all
aspects
of
your
life
3D
TV
is
starting
to
really
take
off
and
the
fact
that
you
re
going
to
be
able
to
view
3D
TV
without
glasses
will
mean
this
innovation
is
more
than
a
fad
Couple
this
with
the
latest
camera
gadgets
that
allow
you
to
shoot
your
own
3D
film
and
this
becomes
a
really
interesting
area
As
founder
of
video
agency
Adjust
Your
Set
Chris
Gorell
Barnes
is
well
placed
to
comment
on
increasing
importance
of
video
Video
will
be
everywhere
So
prevalent
has
video
become
as
the
pre
eminent
communication
tool
of
our
age
that
Cisco
has
claimed
that
by
2015
1m
minutes
of
video
will
cross
the
internet
every
second
The
next
12
months
we
ll
see
a
rise
in
communication
and
engagement
using
video
across
multiple
channels
There
will
also
be
a
rise
in
mobile
as
a
marketing
channel
particularly
mobile
vouchers
and
these
devices
working
together
engaging
with
content
that
will
lead
to
sales
for
brands
both
via
e
commerce
and
in
store
Michael
Steckler
Managing
Director
Northern
Europe
for
Criteo
told
us
Connected
TV
Video
online
driven
by
both
social
applications
and
devices
the
way
we
consume
TV
will
never
be
the
same
again
morphing
into
sophisticated
applications
which
allow
you
to
interact
in
real
time
Miso
and
Zeebox
are
a
couple
of
examples
of
companies
that
are
really
taking
the
lead
in
the
social
video
space
Video
is
an
area
where
we
will
probably
see
more
consolidation
With
160bn
to
play
for
globally
it
s
an
extremely
hot
area
and
much
like
display
advertising
we
may
start
to
see
a
divergence
between
video
advertising
that
has
a
more
direct
response
utilising
data
multiple
creative
and
real
time
user
feedback
and
brand
advertising
which
will
be
driven
more
by
the
content
experience
engaging
formats
and
new
distribution
channels
Personalisation
and
integration
Overall
respondents
felt
that
2012
would
see
an
increased
leap
into
multichannel
with
more
accurate
data
attribution
and
tracking
combining
with
increased
use
of
mobile
technology
to
create
a
more
socially
driven
experience
Dan
Robins
is
Head
of
Paid
Search
at
Carat
iProspect
I
think
2012
will
be
the
first
year
digital
properly
bridges
the
gap
into
offline
Carat
has
proven
the
link
between
search
and
in
store
sales
Google
is
releasing
more
voucher
type
products
QR
codes
have
really
exploded
despite
many
years
in
the
doldrums
to
name
a
few
and
I
think
advertisers
are
no
longer
able
to
view
their
online
channel
in
isolation
Added
to
this
I
think
digital
marketers
will
finally
make
the
break
through
into
exactly
how
to
get
to
grips
with
attribution
modelling
For
all
too
long
we
ve
been
talking
about
it
as
being
important
to
look
into
but
the
models
have
been
slow
to
produce
unwieldy
and
really
speaking
didn
t
show
to
much
of
use
As
cross
channel
technologies
such
as
Ignition
One
and
Marin
develop
and
their
use
grows
more
advertisers
will
find
it
easier
to
build
cross
channel
attribution
models
and
actually
put
them
to
good
use
driving
efficiency
in
their
activity
This
increased
ability
to
track
consumer
behaviour
looks
set
to

As

paperless

tablets

The
Mirror
relaunched
its
website
this
week
with
a
cleaner
design
and
integration
of
personalisation
technology
I
ve
been
talking
to
Product
Director
at
Trinity
Mirror
and
Econsultancy
guest
blogger
Malcolm
Coles
about
the
thinking
behind
the
new
site
design
Why
have
you
relaunched
the
site
The
old
website
has
been
around
for
several
years
with
an
old
content
management
system
We
wanted
to
give
our
journalists
a
more
modern
tool
to
publish
their
work
and
we
also
needed
a
new
platform
which
would
enable
us
to
integrate
social
media
more
effectively
Now
we
have
a
new
CMS
and
we
re
trying
new
technology
such
as
the
personalised
news
suggestions
from
London
based
startup
Rummble
Labs
What
are
the
main
goals
of
the
new
site
We
aim
to
increase
the
number
of
pages
viewed
per
visit
by
each
user
and
features
such
as
the
personalised
recommendations
will
help
us
to
achieve
this
Another
aim
is
to
showcase
our
great
photography
more
than
we
did
with
the
old
site
That
one
had
plenty
of
photos
but
didn
t
really
provide
the
space
the
show
them
properly
Now
journalists
can
add
metadata
to
posts
with
great
photos
and
they
will
be
given
more
prominence
We
also
wanted
to
have
fewer
ad
slots
but
make
them
more
appealing
and
therefore
more
valuable
to
users
We
re
definitely
not
going
down
the
paywall
route
Also
comments
will
be
open
on
all
articles
by
default
which
is
the
opposite
of
how
it
used
to
be
so
we
hope
this
will
encourage
more
people
to
stick
around
and
leave
their
views
They
ll
be
on
now
for
most
stories
though
for
legal
reasons
not
every
single
one
How
do
you
handle
comments
We
use
the
latest
version
of
Pluck
which
has
some
built
in
moderation
tools
and
we
post
moderate
all
comments
in
part
relying
on
readers
to
flag
inappropriate
comments
How
does
the
personalisation
work
The
old
site
was
relatively
cluttered
and
though
we
promoted
a
lot
of
stories
on
thr
homepage
I
think
it
gave
people
has
less
idea
of
where
to
look
and
go
on
the
site
Before
launching
this
version
we
spent
a
lot
of
time
working
out
how
to
help
people
find
what
they
want
People
tend
to
snack
on
news
sites
maybe
browsing
during
breaks
lunch
hours
and
so
on
and
personalisation
helps
them
to
find
something
that
will
interest
them
The
technology
will
learn
from
the
articles
that
people
choose
to
read
as
they
browse
the
site
and
will
recommend
a
further
reading
list
at
the
right
hand
side
of
articles
These
are
based
on
the
user
s
viewing
history
and
will
recommend
stories
based
on
this
and
what
other
people
who
liked
the
same
article
also
liked
In
addition
users
can
sign
in
with
their
Facebook
logins
and
receive
recommendations
based
on
their
interests
Recommended
news
pulls
up
a
list
so
a
30
year
old
woman
with
an
interest
in
celebrity
sees
something
different
than
a
40
year
old
Arsenal
supporting
man
One
thing
I
noticed
on
the
new
site
was
the
mega
drop
down
menus
These
are
now
common
in
e
commerce
but
less
so
on
news
sites
Yes
e
commerce
sites
have
increasingly
used
these
as
a
way
of
allowing
people
to
see
each
section
at
a
glance
quickly
access
product
pages
deep
in
the
site
In
the
same
way
these
provide
our
users
with
a
shortcut
to
the
main
stories
in
each
menu
as
well
as
allowing
them
to
see
the
top
stories
in
each
section
at
a
glance
Now
you
ve
launched
the
new
site
will
you
continue
to
test
and
tweak
With
the
previous
redesign
in
2008
it
was
launched
and
then
nothing
much
was
changed
after
that
There
were
a
lot
of
user
testing
before
relaunching
this
version
of
the
site
and
we
ll
be
using
lots
of
MVT
as
we
go
on
as
well
as
learning
what
works
and
what
doesn
t
from
web
analytics
data
Which
sections
people
use
most
how
they
navigate
around
the
site
and
so
on
We
ll
then
be
able
to
make
changes
to
improve
and
increase
usage
of
the
site
Have
you
relaunched
the
mobile
site
too
What
proportion
of
traffic
comes
through
this
channel
Yes
we
ve
also
launched
m
mirror
co
uk
mobile
site
all
built
in
HTML5
Mobile
traffic
currently
accounts
for
an
eighth
of
all
traffic
though
it
wouldn
t
surprise
me
if
it
overtakes
online
at
some
point
Later
in
the
year
we
ll
also
be
looking
at
iPads
and
tablets
the
question
is
whether
we
design
apps
or
optimise
for
tablets
using
style
sheets

Launched
in
2011
Tripomatic
is
a
new
website
which
helps
users
plan
holidays
as
well
as
activities
and
places
to
see
wherever
they
go
I
ve
been
asking
the
team
about
Tripomatic
In
one
sentence
what
is
Tripomatic
Tripomatic
is
a
free
trip
planner
that
makes
planning
holiday
easy
fast
and
fun
What
problems
does
Tripomatic
solve
Planning
a
trip
usually
takes
a
lot
of
time
and
it
can
be
quite
frustrating
You
have
to
go
through
many
websites
to
get
all
necessary
information
print
a
bunch
of
papers
and
you
are
still
not
sure
you
will
find
your
way
in
the
city
We
wanted
to
change
that
We
developed
a
website
that
recommends
must
see
places
in
a
selected
destination
People
can
choose
what
they
want
to
see
and
add
activities
for
each
day
of
their
trip
In
addition
they
can
also
keep
track
of
flights
and
accommodation
and
see
how
far
the
places
are
Everything
is
displayed
on
the
map
for
easier
orientation
After
planning
the
trip
users
can
download
their
personalised
travel
guide
and
use
it
on
the
trip
When
and
why
did
you
launch
it
Tripomatic
launched
in
June
2011
after
7
months
of
development
We
decided
to
make
a
tool
for
holiday
planning
after
spending
hours
on
preparing
our
own
trip
to
Switzerland
Some
people
may
think
planning
is
a
great
part
of
travelling
but
we
are
definitely
not
one
of
them
Who
is
your
target
audience
Our
target
audience
are
independent
travellers
who
want
to
make
the
most
of
their
holiday
What
are
your
immediate
goals
We
are
intensively
working
on
our
mobile
app
that
should
be
launched
soon
Another
goal
is
to
increase
our
coverage
Right
now
we
cover
most
of
Europe
and
the
USA
but
we
want
to
extend
the
coverage
by
two
more
continents
till
the
end
of
the
year
What
were
the
biggest
challenges
involved
in
building
Tripomatic
Making
Tripomatic
very
easy
to
use
We
have
tons
of
ideas
what
would
be
great
to
have
at
the
website
but
we
learned
to
be
careful
with
new
features
In
the
past
we
added
functionality
that
seemed
very
useful
but
user
testing
showed
that
our
visitors
found
it
confusing
or
too
difficult
to
use
and
it
had
negative
impact
on
the
overall
user
experience
How
will
the
company
make
money
Tripomatic
offers
booking
accommodation
car
hire
city
tours
and
other
services
We
get
a
commission
on
each
sale
made
through
our
website
Who
is
in
the
team
and
what
does
it
look
like
Unlike
most
startups
Tripomatic
com
is
a
family
business
and
is
owned
by
a
married
couple
They
both
have
great
experience
in
online
marketing
and
website
development
Besides
the
owners
there
are
three
developers
three
people
in
marketing
and
four
content
editors
We
focus
mostly
on
product
development
adding
new
content
and
promoting
the
website
Most
of
us
were
working
together
on
another
travel
website
before
As
all
team
members
love
travelling
lots
of
ideas
for
new
features
come
from
using
Tripomatic
on
our
own
trips
Where
would
you
like
to
be
in
one
three
and
five
year
s
time
In
one
year
we
would
like
to
have
an
awesome
product
that
will
be
used
and
loved
by
travellers
We
want
to
cover
all
major
tourist
destinations
all
round
the
world
We
also
hope
that
our
mobile
app
will
be
successful
and
it
will
become
one
of
the
best
apps
for
travel
planning
In
three
years
we
want
to
be
a
well
known
brand
and
be
profitable
And
where
would
we
like
to
be
in
five
year
s
time
Seychelles
No
seriously
it
is
just
way
too
far
in
the
future
for
us
we
never
plan
for
such
a
long
time
ahead

Leading
supermarket
first
to
implement
personalised
retargeting
for
groceries
LONDON
9
FEBRUARY
2012
Criteo
the
global
leader
in
performance
display
advertising
today
announced
that
Waitrose
has
selected
its
industry
leading
solution
for
implementation
on
its
website
Waitrose
com
The
partnership
will
make
Waitrose
the
first
supermarket
in
the
UK
to
use
online
personalised
retargeting
for
groceries
helping
to
drive
consumer
relationships
Visitors
to
Waitrose
com
will
be
presented
with
highly
relevant
products
and
offers
on
selected
media
sites
as
part
of
their
internet
journey
upon
leaving
the
site
This
development
marks
an
important
step
in
Waitrose
s
investment
in
its
ecommerce
platform
over
the
last
year
which
included
the
opening
of
a
dedicated
Dotcom
Fulfilment
Centre
in
West
London
Waitrose
s
commitment
to
its
online
channel
enabled
the
retailer
to
increase
online
sales
by
49
in
the
seven
days
leading
up
to
Christmas
2011
As
the
industry
leader
Criteo
was
an
obvious
choice
for
us
enabling
us
to
present
consumers
with
relevant
and
up
to
date
product
information
in
a
visually
rewarding
way
said
Nick
White
Head
of
Online
Commercial
at
Waitrose
We
are
driving
innovation
in
the
grocery
sector
by
being
the
first
supermarket
to
adopt
personalised
retargeting
enhancing
our
ecommerce
strategy
and
making
online
shopping
even
easier
for
our
customers
We
are
already
seeing
a
tenfold
increase
in
the
click
through
rate
compared
to
non
targeted
display
activity
as
well
as
a
high
level
of
conversions
Criteo
leverages
consumer
intent
in
the
same
way
as
search
advertising
by
showing
ads
for
products
based
on
the
browsing
behaviour
of
people
on
Waitrose
com
Criteo
uses
a
predictive
engine
that
is
able
to
recommend
products
based
on
the
behaviour
of
other
consumers
that
have
viewed
the
same
or
similar
products
The
adverts
are
created
in
real
time
to
ensure
consideration
of
stock
availability
and
pricing
Waitrose
can
easily
track
the
success
throughout
by
comparing
the
cost
of
sale
with
the
click
through
purchase
cost
to
ensure
that
it
remains
viable
and
successful
It
is
great
to
see
an
industry
leader
such
as
Waitrose
driving
innovation
in
the
retail
sector
Michael
Steckler
MD
for
Northern
Europe
at
Criteo
said
We
share
a
common
goal
as
we
continually
aim
to
provide
consumers
with
a
more
relevant
online
shopping
experience
he
added
Developments
are
also
in
progress
to
enable
Waitrose
to
present
consumers
with
items
that
they
have
forgotten
to
place
in
their
online
trolley
prior
to
the
delivery
date
as
well
as
re
advertise
purchased
items
once
they
re
likely
to
have
been
consumed

Al

holiday

Al
Mouloud
holiday
the
mixture
of
the
sacred
and
the
profane
By
Larbi
Arbaoui
Morocco
World
News
Taroudant
Morocco
February
5
2012
Like
many
Muslim
countries
the
Moroccan
people
celebrate
the
birth
of
the
Prophet
Mohammad
Peace
be
upon
him
on
February
5
This
celebration
is
known
by
different
names
in
the
Islamic
world
In
Morocco
it
s
called
Eid
Al
Mouloud
or
simply
Al
Mouloud
It
is
an
occasion
when
Moroccans
show
their
devotion
to
their
faith
a
spiritual
day
to
recall
the
ideals
of
Islam
and
recite
poems
dedicated
to
the
Prophet
though
some
of
the
cultural
conventions
surrounding
this
holiday
have
little
to
do
with
Islam
On
February
5
when
walking
past
a
mosque
spiritually
uplifting
recitations
of
the
holy
Quran
can
be
heard
People
exchange
visits
and
organize
religious
parties
at
which
Al
Mouloudiate
a
series
of
long
poems
eulogising
and
praising
the
Prophet
Mohammad
are
recited
The
most
famous
poem
is
Al
Burdah
by
Sheikh
Al
Bussiri
In
early
morning
men
will
walk
together
to
the
graveyard
singing
Al
Burdah
and
women
will
warble
you
yous
when
the
men
pass
by
In
the
evening
the
sound
of
the
Attalba
reading
the
Quran
and
reciting
hymns
glorifying
God
can
be
heard
coming
from
houses
along
with
the
fragrant
odor
of
incense
and
sandal
wood
The
Attalba
are
religious
people
who
memorize
the
Quran
and
master
the
Islamic
legislature
They
read
and
recite
until
dinner
traditionally
couscous
is
served
The
city
of
Sal
on
the
Bou
Regreg
estuary
holds
a
lantern
procession
on
Al
Mouloud
called
Dor
Eshamaa
In
Meknes
in
the
square
of
Saint
Sheikh
Al
Kamel
the
celebration
on
this
day
takes
a
barbaric
turn
Men
and
women
engage
in
wild
dances
using
knives
to
strike
their
foreheads
and
eat
hot
embers
and
drink
boiling
water
The
dancers
who
wear
white
see
themselves
in
an
ecstatic
state
of
joy
Visitors
must
wear
white
in
order
to
participate
or
risk
receiving
violent
treatment
Wearing
black
or
red
is
considered
an
offense
and
those
who
do
may
have
their
clothes
torn
Perhaps
the
strangest
aspect
of
this
ceremony
is
the
custom
of
the
infirm
laying
at
the
gate
of
the
shrine
in
order
for
the
the
Aisawa
followers
of
the
Saint
to
heal
them
by
walking
on
their
backs
In
Tazarine
Al
Mouloud
is
considered
an
important
and
dignified
day
In
the
early
morning
readings
of
the
holy
Quran
can
be
heard
from
a
distance
Men
dress
in
white
and
exchange
smiles
and
expressions
of
courtesy
The
day
of
Tazlaft
when
couscous
is
served
is
the
busiest
day
with
loud
music
from
tambourines
It
is
believed
that
thanks
to
Saint
Sidi
Amrou
a
dish
of
couscous
twice
as
wide
as
the
width
of
the
door
can
be
passed
through
the
door
Tradition
says
that
anyone
who
looks
while
the
miracle
takes
place
will
be
struck
blind
On
Al
Mouloud
the
sacred
coexists
with
the
profane
In
Meknes
for
example
at
the
same
time
as
some
are
engaged
in
the
pagan
ritual
of
ecstatic
dancing
others
are
inside
mosques
reading
the
Quran
or
studying
the
Prophet

Moroccan
Women
and
Body
as
a
Means
of
Power
Moroccan
Women
and
Body
as
a
Means
of
Power

Women
have
celebrated
in
the
last
decades
their
emancipation
from
the
constraints
of
a
traditionally
man
s
world
The
fair
sex
has
proven
itself
in
many
domains
Women
have
become
engaged
in
politics
and
so
are
able
to
take
part
in
defending
their
rights
and
creating
change
though
what
change
is
required
is
understood
differently
among
different
groups
Women
have
been
in
the
media
thanks
to
the
hard
work
of
many
years
to
empower
their
gender
in
the
Arab
world
Some
Moroccan
women
have
used
their
bodies
as
part
of
a
feminist
agenda
After
years
of
fighting
political
and
social
constraints
a
new
form
of
protest
has
arisen
In
Morocco
some
women
have
shown
up
semi
nude
and
others
threatened
to
appear
nude
in
the
streets
or
on
TV
to
challenge
the
Islamists
that
dominate
the
newly
nominated
govenment
of
BenKirane
the
leader
of
PJD
For
example
the
Moroccan
celebrity
actress
Latifa
Ahrar
showed
her
shaved
legs
and
breasts
to
national
and
international
cameras
at
the
Marrakesh
Film
Festival
And
she
has
commented
that
she
won
t
stop
performing
in
a
semi
nude
theater
role
which
serves
as
a
challenge
to
the
Islamic
party
PJD
Ahrar
has
already
played
a
theater
role
in
a
play
called
Kafara
Naoum
requiring
semi
nudity
Another
example
of
women
using
their
body
as
a
means
of
power
can
be
seen
in
some
new
Moroccan
movies
For
instance
the
erotic
role
played
by
Fatima
El
Ayachi
in
El
Maouchouma
El
Ayachi
said
that
she
was
challenging
convention
and
that
she
is
ready
to
play
other
bold
roles
She
also
commented
that
the
body
and
indecency
are
not
the
same
and
that
she
is
proud
of
this
movie
and
herself
as
a
Muslim
Moroccan
Amazigh
woman
In
this
way
a
woman
s
body
has
functioned
as
a
tool
of
protest
against
any
patriarch
who
claims
that
the
her
body
is
shameful
and
indecent
and
should
be
hidden
from
public
view
Some
women
like
those
mentioned
previously
have
used
their
bodies
as
a
means
of
honor
and
power
to
call
for
freedom
from
oppression
and
from
injustice
against
their
sex
They
have
utilised
their
beauty
to
provoke
the
Islamists
who
have
been
called
misogynists
Protest
in
the
shape
of
a
woman
s
body
has
raised
many
questions
about
the
teachings
of
Islam
and
the
social
conventions
of
Moroccan
society

CAIRO

February

AFP
Saboteurs
on
Sunday
blew
up
a
pipeline
that
supplies
gas
to
Israel
the
12th
such
attack
in
a
year
security
officials
said
Masked
gunmen
planted
explosives
under
the
pipeline
in
the
Al
Massaeed
area
close
to
the
town
of
El
Arish
in
the
north
of
the
Sinai
peninsula
they
said
Witnesses
said
they
heard
a
very
loud
explosion
before
a
large
fire
broke
out
Sources
say
the
attack
on
the
pipeline
came
the
day
after
an
Islamist
leader
from
the
area
died
in
his
prison
cell
in
Cairo
Interior
ministry
officials
said
he
died
from
natural
causes
Emergency
services
were
rushed
to
the
scene
to
try
to
control
the
blaze
the
official
said
adding
that
there
were
no
immediate
reports
of
casualties
The
pipeline
which
carries
gas
through
the
Sinai
and
on
to
Jordan
and
Israel
has
already
been
attacked
11
times
over
the
past
year
the
first
during
the
mass
uprisings
that
drove
president
Hosni
Mubarak
from
power
in
February
2011
Gas
deliveries
to
Israel
agreed
under
Mubarak
have
come
under
heavy
criticism
in
Egypt
Israel
generates
40
percent
of
its
electricity
using
natural
gas
and
Egypt
provides
43
percent
of
its
gas
supplies
Egyptian
gas
also
covers
80
percent
of
Jordan
s
electricity
production
demand
6
8
million
cubic
metres
a
day
Egypt
s
Sinai
region
is
particularly
security
sensitive
due
to
tensions
with
the
Bedouin
community
living
there
which
is
heavily
armed
Many
goods
are
smuggled
to
the
Palestinian
enclave
of
Gaza
through
the
Sinai
which
the
Israelis
also
charge
is
a
rear
base
for
militant
attacks
against
its
territory

Culture
is
pristine
yet
it
s
subject
to
being
unauthenticized
and
de
contextualized
Culture
as
perceived
by
locals
is
always
authentic
I
am
talking
here
about
both
tangible
and
intangible
aspects
of
culture
When
tourists
come
in
the
guise
of
neocolonialism
cultures
are
altered
commodified
and
hegemonized
opening
the
door
wide
open
to
many
interpretations
and
amendments
The
local
pure
culture
becomes
in
my
view
like
an
old
whore
opening
its
legs
to
whoever
pays
more
wearing
cheap
cosmetics
to
meet
the
clients
needs
When
the
cultural
value
is
being
transformed
by
a
commercial
one
the
meaning
of
culture
is
lost
and
the
pure
past
is
re
told
aloof
from
the
original
version
When
we
sell
culture
as
a
commodity
we
rob
our
locals
of
any
sense
of
belonging
Culture
hence
becomes
a
hybrid
almost
like
the
parrot
that
tried
to
imitate
the
pigeon
s
walk
and
ended
up
walking
in
a
weird
ugly
way
as
the
Moroccan
legend
goes
The
parrot
in
this
respect
is
the
culture
that
is
commodified
to
fit
the
tourists
desires
without
taking
into
account
the
locals
needs
and
without
respecting
their
glorious
past
Marie
Fran
oise
Lanfant
states
that
when
tourism
increases
culture
declines
There
are
a
lot
of
examples
of
Moroccan
culture
we
no
longer
see
today
or
we
see
them
in
new
forms
Take
the
example
of
the
story
tellers
in
the
mythical
square
of
Jemaa
El
fna
Marrakesh
In
the
past
that
was
a
real
entertainment
for
the
locals
with
both
socio
economic
and
educational
perspectives
a
pure
culture
The
story
teller
was
a
well
read
man
a
scholar
a
historian
etc
Today
story
telling
is
becoming
a
mere
spectacle
devoid
of
any
humanistic
meaning
and
is
seen
to
be
authentic
only
by
tourists
because
they
see
through
different
lens
that
distort
the
genuine
authenticity
of
this
art
lens
that
satiate
their
unconscious
fantasies
and
dreams
Even
the
food
in
our
culture
is
altered
commodified
and
othered
The
Moroccan
couscous
is
no
longer
keeping
its
secret
within
the
confines
of
this
nation
It
s
re
packaged
and
marketed
worldwide
As
something
deeply
rooted
in
the
Moroccan
culture
couscous
is
not
becoming
authentic
any
more
Chances
are
that
when
you
eat
couscous
in
Morocco
in
a
Moroccan
restaurant
you
are
not
eating
authentic
Couscous
that
our
mothers
and
grandmothers
used
to
roll
in
their
Baraka
palms
and
serve
for
couple
of
hands
to
share
on
a
table
of
brotherhood
Worse
when
you
eat
it
outside
the
country
chances
are
you
will
end
up
eating
something
named
couscous
but
has
nothing
to
do
with
our
cultural
dish
It
s
devalued
de
contextualized
defamed
and
drained
of
its
entire
cultural
load
Consequently
tourism
is
demonizing
the
local
culture
and
simplifying
it
to
a
trademark
a
cheap
commodity
in
a
luring
package
a
titillating
attraction
In
brief
Marx
s
natural
use
value
of
culture
is
put
on
the
line
Marco
Polo
traveled
for
some
24
years
but
never
meant
to
distort
the
Chinese
culture
he
met
Today
however
and
to
Marco
s
dismay
the
Wall
of
China
is
becoming
a
commodity
with
modernized
cafes
malls
and
parking
lots
The
Chinese
nowadays
don
t
consider
the
Great
Wall
great
it
s
becoming
part
of
a
modern
life
Likewise
Mardi
Gras
or
Fat
Tuesday
in
New
Orleans
Louisiana
is
no
longer
conceived
as
a
local
indigenous
heritage
and
a
celebration
rich
of
symbolism
Rather
it
s
becoming
a
commodity
which
is
promoted
by
marketers
to
gain
more
money
without
caring
for
the
damage
they
made
to
the
local
culture
Who
cares
now
about
those
women
who
exchange
their
breasts
for
beads
Or
are
they
mere
trivialities
and
commodities
We
should
as
a
matter
of
fact
go
beyond
this
image
and
look
at
the
other
side
of
the
coin
We
should
give
culture
the
value
it
deserves
Suffice
it
if
we
sell
tangible
aspects
of
our
cultures
There
is
no
urgent
need
to
barter
our
dear
human
culture
for
a
few
euros
and
dollars
exchange
our
kids
and
women
s
flesh
in
the
sacred
name
of
the
promotion
of
tourism
with
old
octogenarian
human
predators
In
a
nutshell
tourism
is
bad
Our
cultures
are
endangered

Withdraws
Recognition
of
the
Regime
of
Bashar
Al
Aassad
By
Mourad
Anouar
Morocco
World
News
Oklahoma
City
February
4
2012
In
the
wake
of
another
bloody
massacre
in
which
over
200
people
were
killed
and
over
1
000
injured
in
the
central
city
of
Homs
on
Friday
night
by
the
Syrian
regime
Tunisia
decided
on
Saturday
to
expel
the
Syrian
ambassador
to
Tunis
and
to
withdraw
its
recognition
of
the
regime
of
Bashar
al
Assad
as
the
legitimate
representative
of
the
Syrian
people
announced
the
Tunisian
presidency
According
to
a
statement
on
his
Facebook
page
the
Tunisian
president
called
on
the
president
Assad
to
step
down
in
order
to
help
spare
Syrian
blood
Moncef
Marzouki
went
on
to
say
that
the
only
solution
for
the
crisis
in
Syria
is
the
removal
from
power
of
Bashar
al
Assad
and
the
launch
of
a
democratic
transition
In
an
interview
with
Aljazeera
on
Saturday
Tunisia
s
Secretary
of
State
Abdessalem
Rafik
said
that
Tunisia
as
it
has
been
proactive
in
starting
the
revolution
it
makes
sense
to
be
proactive
in
solidarity
with
our
brothers
in
Syria
This
is
the
most
expected
attitude
expressed
by
this
government
that
derives
its
legitimacy
from
the
revolution
he
added
He
also
hoped
that
most
Arab
country
especially
Egypt
Morocco
and
the
Gulf
countries
would
follow
Tunisia
in
its
step
toward
severing
all
ties
with
the
Syrian
regime
Tunisia
s
daring
move
came
after
Russia
and
China
s
veto
today
to
a
U
N
Security
Council
resolution
aimed
at
ending
Syria
s
bloodshed
among
concerns
that
Damascus
might
heighten
its
clampdown
on
the
protestors
who
entered
their
nearly
11
month
uprising

Getting
Lost
on
Florida
s
Forgotten
Coast
Posted

Christopher

St
George
Island
Fla
is
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
And
that
s
the
way
they
like
it
Why
else
would
they
call
this
area
along
the
northeastern
part
of
Florida
s
panhandle
the
forgotten
coast
It
is
remote
undeveloped
and
at
this
time
of
year
no
one
s
here
Oh
wait
I
should
have
said
no
tourists
Out
in
the
flat
as
glass
Apalachicola
Bay
every
morning
we
found
dozens
of
oyster
boats
quietly
harvesting
the
famous
shellfish
from
the
shallow
sea
floor
They
say
it
gets
busy
during
the
summer
but
it
s
a
different
kind
of
busy
than
frenetic
Panama
City
to
the
west
or
St
Petersburg
the
closest
major
city
along
the
coast
as
you
head
southeast
Forgotten
coast
busy
means
something
else
It
s
a
little
harder
to
find
a
parking
spot
at
St
George
Island
State
Park
but
the
beach
remains
subdued
by
Sunshine
State
standards
You
might
have
a
hard
time
getting
a
seat
at
Harry
A
s
or
BJ
s
around
dinnertime
on
the
weekends
but
otherwise
they
say
it
s
more
or
less
the
same
place
all
year
round
Our
vacation
rental
looked
out
over
the
bay
The
units
on
the
other
two
sides
were
dark
their
windows
shuttered
for
the
season
We
watched
the
sun
rise
over
the
ocean
in
the
morning
as
we
sipped
tea
To
find
a
strong
cup
of
espresso
but
you
have
to
drive
across
two
long
bridges
into
Apalachicola
to
find
it
It
s
at
the
Cafe
Con
Leche
The
biggest
attraction
on
St
George
other
than
the
state
park
and
the
ever
present
oystermen
is
the
lighthouse
Back
in
2005
the
Cape
St
George
Lighthouse
fell
into
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
Preservationists
rallied
to
save
the
1852
landmark
and
in
late
2008
the
reconstructed
tower
reopened
A
new
museum
just
next
door
is
only
a
few
weeks
old
We
also
swung
by
the
Apalachicola
National
Estuarine
Research
Reserve
to
check
out
its
recently
opened
exhibit
my
daughter
offers
a
tour
of
the
fish
tanks
in
the
video
below
It
s
one
of
only
28
national
estuarine
research
reserves
nationwide
and
you
ll
leave
with
a
much
clearer
picture
of
why
areas
like
these
are
worth
protecting
In
talking
with
the
few
year
round
residents
of
St
George
Island
we
met
it
became
clear
that
getting
forgotten
is
a
good
thing
in
a
place
like
Florida
Most
of
the
coastal
areas
are
overdeveloped
with
high
rise
hotels
and
condos
competing
for
the
best
view
of
the
gulf
or
the
ocean
It
s
fun
for
a
few
days
of
R
R
maybe
or
maybe
not
In
order
to
really
appreciate
the
remoteness
of
the
forgotten
coast
you
have
to
head
inland
to
the
Apalachicola
National
Forest
On
our
last
day
we
did
just
that
Covering
more
than
half
a
million
acres
it
s
the
largest
national
forest
in
the
state
and
true
to
its
billing
it
showed
us
what
this
place
must
have
looked
like
before
the
area
was
settled
At
a
remote
campground
which
at
this
time
of
year
was
abandoned
we
ran
into
the
only
person
we
d
seen
all
day
a
woman
who
worked
at
nearby
Tyndall
Air
Force
Base
She
was
looking
for
the
lighthouse
on
St
George
Island
and
had
gotten
lost
along
the
way
We
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
bay
admiring
the
chocolate
milk
colored
water
framed
by
seagrass
and
I
said
to
her
Being
lost
isn
t
so
bad
is
it
No
she
said
Not
here

St

We

to

it
We

We

the

Jennifer
Garcia
Alonso
is
co
founder
of
The
Purple
Passport
a
web
based
collection
of
chic
one
stop
shop
guides
to
experiencing
the
world
s
cities
in
style
She
is
a
New
Yorker
who
has
been
living
in
Abu
Dhabi
the
capital
of
the
United
Arab
Emirates
for
the
past
three
years
which
we
think
qualifies
her
as
a
local
at
this
point
Check
out
Jennifer
s
take
on
her
home
away
from
home
then
leave
a
comment
below
if
you
have
anything
to
add
Abu
Dhabi
is
My
City
The
first
place
I
take
a
visitor
from
out
of
town
is
Sheikh
Zayed
Grand
Mosque
an
architectural
wonder
It
is
the
largest
Mosque
outside
of
Mecca
or
Medina
When
I
crave
Indian
food
I
always
go
to
Ushna
in
The
Souk
at
Qaryat
al
Beri
Don
t
miss
the
black
lentils
and
the
terrace
seating
with
views
of
the
Grand
Mosque
Overall
Indian
food
in
Abu
Dhabi
is
exceptional
To
escape
the
city
I
head
out
to
the
Qasr
al
Sarab
Desert
Resort
by
Anantara
It
is
located
about
90
minutes
outside
the
city
among
the
deep
desert
dunes
Qasr

Sarab
Desert
Resort

Garcia
Alonso
If
I
want
to
shop
I
go
to
the
impressive
Marina
Mall
For
complete
quiet
I
can
hide
away
at
Yas
Links
golf
course
Even
non
golfers
can
enjoy
the
luxurious
pool
and
outdoor
dining
with
views
of
the
golf
course
and
water
If
you
come
to
my
city
get
your
picture
taken
with
a
camel
You
can
find
them
right
in
town
at
the
Abu
Dhabi
Heritage
Village
or
if
you
book
a
4
4
desert
safari
you
are
sure
to
encounter
a
few
many
of
the
desert
safaris
also
offer
camel
rides
If
you
have
to
order
one
thing
off
the
menu
from
Hakkasan
it
has
to
be
the
Jasmine
tea
soaked
Wagyu
beef
ribs
Magrudy
s
is
my
one
stop
shop
for
great
books
As
an
expat
I
love
a
taste
of
home
and
they
will
order
almost
any
book
in
print
for
you
Locals
know
to
skip
those
boring
hotel
bars
and
check
out
the
dramatic
Skylite
at
the
Yas
Viceroy
Hotel
located
inside
the
Formula
1
circuit
instead
When
I
m
feeling
cash
strapped
I
go
to
the
beach
For
a
huge
splurge
I
go
to
dessert
and
coffee
at
the
Emirates
Palace
hotel
Pricey
pastries
are
dusted
in
gold
and
if
you
are
really
adventurous
you
can
get
a
cappuccino
made
with
camel
milk
The
opulent
hotel
is
worth
a
visit
in
itself
it
cost
around
3
billion
USD
to
construct
and
is
an
important
Abu
Dhabi
landmark
If
you
are
really
splurging
pick
up
some
gold
in
the
lobby
vending
machine
Photo
ops
in
my
city
include
the
Corniche
and
the
Sheikh
Zayed
Grand
Mosque
The
best
vantage
points
are
Heritage
Village
and
The
Souk
at
Qaryat
al
Beri
respectively
in
both
spots
you
get
views
from
across
the
water
If
my
city
were
a
celebrity
it
d
be
Colin
Firth
international
strong
and
relatively
reserved
The
most
random
thing
about
my
city
is
the
nail
salons
and
spas
They
are
everywhere
and
if
you
are
willing
to
venture
outside
your
hotel
relatively
economical
Women
here
are
especially
well
groomed
My
city
has
the
most
international
men
and
women
While
Emirati
locals
of
course
play
a
crucial
role
in
defining
the
culture
and
trajectory
of
the
city
most
people
who
live
in
Abu
Dhabi
are
not
from
here
In
my
city
an
active
day
outdoors
involves
water
sports
Check
out
the
Al
Forsan
complex
for
wake
boarding
and
water
skiing
offerings
My
city
s
best
museum
is
yet
to
come
Abu
Dhabi
locations
of
The
Louvre
and
The
Guggenheim
as
well
as
an
impressive
National
Museum
are
planned
for
the
future
My
favorite
jogging
walking
route
is
the
Corniche
downtown
with
views
of
the
Arabian
Gulf
For
a
night
of
dancing
go
to
Allure
on
Yas
Island
Or
for
live
music
check
out
the
Yas
Island
Concert
Series
Everyone
from
Guns
N
Roses
to
Shakira
to
Janet
Jackson
to
Metallica
has
performed
here
Maroush
is
the
spot
for
late
night
eats
Shawarma
time
To
find
out
what
s
going
on
at
night
and
on
the
weekends
read
Time
Out
You
can
tell
a
lot
about
my
city
from
a
walk
downtown
Notice
all
of
the
languages
and
nationalities
represented
You
can
tell
if
someone
is
from
my
city
if
they
smell
wonderful
Perfumes
and
colognes
are
a
big
part
of
local
culture

In
the
winter
you
should
play
outside
This
is
when
the
weather
is
at
its
best
water
sports
golf
tennis
and
desert
excursions
are
all
perfect
winter
choices
In
the
spring
you
should
see
Abu
Dhabi
from
the
water
Hire
a
dhow
traditional
wooden
boat
for
a
tour
charter
a
speedboat
to
take
you
to
one
of
the
200
islands
off
the
main
island
or
kayak
in
the
mangroves
In
the
summer
you
should
stay
inside
Temperatures
consistently
remain
above
105F
and
the
humidity
level
is
quite
high
In
the
fall
you
should
hit
the
Formula
1
festivities
the
yachts
in
the
Yas
Marina
the
unbelievable
concerts
and
of
course
the
races
are
all
worth
seeing
A
hidden
gem
in
my
city
is
India
Palace
Another
great
and
economical
choice
for
Indian
eats
For
a
fantastic
breakfast
try
CuiScene
at
the
Fairmont
For
about
25
USD
you
get
a
full
and
I
mean
full
breakfast
buffet
And
the
restaurant
features
a
lovely
terrace
to
boot
Luxury
for
less
Don
t
miss
the
Abu
Dhabi
Art
Fair
in
November
It
brings
together
contemporary
art
and
design
from
all
over
the
world
Just
outside
my
city
you
can
visit
Dubai
It
s
about
a
60
to
80
minute
drive
If
you
come
to
the
UAE
you
get
two
vacations
in
one
With
public
transportation
options
at
a
minimum
the
best
way
to
see
my
city
is
by
car
or
taxi
The
city
is
increasingly
spread
out
with
attractions
like
Ferrari
World
amusement
park
Yas
Marina
Circuit
home
of
the
Formula
1
Monte
Carlo
Beach
Club
and
Saadiyat
Beach
Golf
Club
all
located
a
good
distance
from
City
Center
If
my
city
were
a
pet
it
would
be
a
bird
small
in
size
but
ready
to
fly
If
I
didn
t
live
in
a
city
I
d
live
on
the
beach
somewhere
Warm
weather
is
a
big
thing
for
me
The
best
book
about
my
city
is
From
Rags
to
Riches
A
Story
of
Abu
Dhabi
When
I
think
about
my
city
the
song
that
comes
to
mind
is
Movin
On
Up
While
growth
plans
for
Abu
Dhabi
are
substantially
more
conservative
than
its
sibling
Dubai
new
hotels
malls
office
buildings
attractions
and
high
rise
apartment
buildings
the
deluxe
apartment
in
the
sky
bit
fits
too
are
quickly
appearing
and
the
city
has
gained
critical
importance
on
the
world
stage
If
you
have
kids
you
won
t
want
to
miss
the
hotel
beach
and
pool
clubs
For
example
the
Hiltonia
Beach
Club
offers
day
passes
and
has
child
and
adult
pools
a
beach
water
sports
and
restaurants
National
Day
celebrations
could
only
happen
in
my
city
Emirati
locals
and
non
locals
alike
celebrate
the
young
country
s
birthday
the
UAE
just
turned
40
with
flags
fireworks
special
parades
and
lots
of
driving
and
honking
horns
My
city
should
be
featured
on
your
cover
or
website
because
it
is
cosmopolitan
international
full
of
wonderful
surprises
and
growing
quickly

Welcome
to
the
Wild
West
of
China
my
guide
said
as
we
touched
down
in
Lijiang
after
a
4
hour
ight
from
Shanghai
Though
I
didn
t
yet
spot
any
cowboy
boots
I
was
indeed
far
west
in
the
Yunnan
province
at
the
foothills
of
the
Himalaya
bordered
by
Laos
Vietnam
and
Burma
Impressions
of
Lijiang
performance
Photo
Annie
Fitzsimmons
For
an
instant
introduction
to
the
region
I
attended
a
performance
of
Impressions
of
Lijiang
with
the
sacred
Jade
Dragon
Mountain
looming
behind
the
outdoor
theater
It
is
truly
a
spectacle
of
local
culture
with
hundreds
of
the
minority
Naxi
people
performing
songs
and
dances
And
no
wonder
the
show
is
such
a
creative
triumph
the
force
behind
it
is
Zhang
Yimou
famous
for
directing
the
Opening
and
Closing
Ceremonies
at
the
Beijing
Olympics
I
couldn
t
leave
without
purchasing
a
recording
of
the
music
that
could
transport
me
back
to
Lijiang
over
and
over
again
The
area
is
difficult
to
navigate
on
your
own
I
traveled
on
an
Abercrombie
Kent
itinerary
with
the
warmest
expert
guide
Gerald
Hatherly
He
makes
centuries
of
Chinese
history
come
alive
daily
A
K
is
known
for
making
far
ung
getaways
like
the
Yunnan
accessible
and
also
happens
to
be
celebrating
its
50th
anniversary
this
year
The
Banyan
Tree
was
our
base
in
Lijiang
and
its
architecture
re
ected
the
design
of
the
Naxi
homes
while
providing
all
of
the
comforts
of
a
great
hotel
We
rode
bikes
through
a
valley
of
green
farmland
to
the
village
of
Bai
Sha
and
to
the
infamous
Dr
Ho
who
has
been
credited
with
healing
thousands
of
people
in
his
90
years
I
received
a
quick
eye
scan
from
Dr
Ho
who
instantly
pronounced
with
Gerald
interpreting
healthy
whew
His
of
ce
contains
more
than
50
pots
filled
with
therapeutic
plants
and
herbs
that
he
gathers
in
the
mountains
Dr
Ho
will
proudly
show
you
a
letter
from
the
Mayo
Clinic
thanking
him
for
healing
a
terminally
ill
cancer
patient
I
am
convinced
that
if
I
return
in
30
years
a
120
year
old
Dr
Ho
will
still
be
there
smiling
and
healing
From
Lijiang
we
took
a
stomach
turning
drive
through
the
mountains
to
Shangri
La
or
Zhongdian
An
easy
hour
long
hike
through
the
stunning
Tiger
Leaping
Gorge
provided
me
with
a
much
needed
break
in
the
drive
These
mountains
are
home
to
Khampa
Tibetans
and
the
area
provides
a
look
at
Tibetan
culture
13
000
feet
above
sea
level
Each
morning
from
my
room
at
the
Songstam
Retreat
I
awakened
to
views
of
the
jagged
snow
capped
Himalaya
Gerald
introduced
me
and
my
group
to
farmer
friends
of
his
in
the
town
of
Ringha
who
welcomed
us
in
for
cups
of
yak
butter
tea
and
to
meet
their
new
baby
A
warning
the
tea
is
a
hyper
local
delicacy
and
makes
you
feel
like
you
re
drinking
a
cup
full
of
hot
butter
Songzangling
Monastery
Photo
Annie
Fitzsimmons
The
hotel
overlooks
the
17th
century
Songzangling
Monastery
home
to
hundreds
of
monks
practicing
Tibetan
Buddhism
At
the
bustling
monastery
I
toured
colorful
temples
and
meditation
halls
covered
in
murals
I
was
even
blessed
by
a
living
Buddha
a
very
high
ranking
lama
in
his
prayer
hall
which
kept
me
on
cloud
nine
all
week
As
you
make
your
2012
travel
wish
lists
I
hope
you
consider
adding
this
faraway
corner
of
the
globe
The
Yunnan
is
woefully
under
traveled
with
Westerners
accounting
for
only
1
of
visitors
This
unusual
and
exotic
journey
felt
like
a
well
kept
secret
until
now

After

Super

Everyone
s
Curious
About
Slacklining

Dean
Potter
shows
off
his
highlining
skills
He
can
slackline
too
If
you
saw
the
Super
Bowl
halftime
show
you
probably
wondered
Who
s
that
guy
in
a
toga
bouncing
crazily
on
a
rope
next
to
Madonna
And
how
s
he
doing
it
The
guy
was
Andy
Lewis
a
slacklining
champion
from
California
and
he
did
it
after
many
many
years
of
practice
Slacklining
is
different
from
tightrope
walking
Instead
of
a
taut
line
it
s
performed
on
inch
thick
nylon
webbing
that
stretches
and
bounces
That
lets
folks
like
Lewis
aka
Sketchy
Andy
defy
gravity
like
a
cartoon
character
To
find
out
more
about
it
Pop
Omnivore
spoke
with
climbing
legend
Dean
Potter
who
was
featured
in
a
recent
National
Geographic
story
on
climbing
and
who
s
done
a
bit
of
slacklining
himself
What
is
slacklining
Slacklining
started
in
the
1970s
when
climbers
were
walking
on
nylon
rather
than
tightrope
It
was
more
accessible
for
everyone
because
you
could
do
it
anywhere
and
it
s
like
walking
on
a
one
inch
trampoline
After
that
you
just
start
grooving
with
the
movement
How
did
you
get
into
it
I
first
learned
slacklining
in
1993
from
a
homeless
man
named
Chongo
Charles
Victor
Tucker
III
He
had
a
line
stretched
between
a
blue
Chevy
van
and
a
boulder
and
I
walked
it
first
try
other
passes
have
taken
years
and
years
The
line
finds
your
weaknesses
and
you
have
to
deal
with
a
lot
of
emotions
It
can
become
a
major
form
of
meditation
You
focus
on
nothingness
yet
it
gives
you
everything
How
do
you
feel
when
you
re
on
a
line
I
would
say
I
have
extra
emotion
But
everything
I
do
on
the
line
it
s
not
a
battle
or
an
overcoming
but
it
s
a
oneness
You
become
OK
with
the
fear
and
the
ground
pulling
at
you
Why
you
do
it
I
have
no
rules
I
m
not
limited
by
what
others
have
done
before
and
I
just
do
what
s
natural
for
me
Remain
calm
everyone
can
relate
to
that
Don
t
be
restricted
by
convention
and
limited
by
fear
I
ve
been
practicing
yoga
my
whole
life
My
mom
was
a
yoga
teacher
and
I
started
just
absorbing
by
watching
her
Everything
I
do
is
a
mental
discipline
It
s
not
a
sport
so
much
as
it
is
the
art
of
walking
lines
When
did
variations
like
trick
lining
start
to
emerge
Variations
on
line
walking
have
existed
for
thousands
of
years
and
people
have
always
done
tricks
on
the
line
There
are
a
few
books
on
the
history
of
line
walking
and
you
can
see
people
doing
back
flips
off
the
wires
in
old
black
and
white
pictures
What
did
you
think
of
Andy
Lewis
s
Super
Bowl
performance
I
ve
been
watching
him
since
he
started
and
he
is
at
the
utmost
level
I
was
very
impressed
with
his
composure
What
else
should
people
know
about
slacklining
Slacklining
is
still
considered
more
art
than
sport
For
me
it
s
about
making
myself
and
the
group
I
m
with
a
part
of
the
most
beautiful
nature
painting
I
like
turning
people
on
to
this
magical
thing
that
they
can
do
anywhere
I
ve
taught
3
year
old
kids
and
grandmothers
to
do
it
If
you
can
walk
you
can
walk
on
a
line
Any
words
of
wisdom
for
newbies
There
s
something
compelling
about
the
simple
act
of
walking
a
line
Although
it
s
such
a
simple
exercise
it
takes
all
of
your
focus
and
coordination
to
stand
on
the
line
It
s
hard
for
many
people
to
have
that
same
feeling
in
normal
life
You
have
to
ask
yourself
Do
you
have
the
natural
desire
You
have
to
be
OK
with
falling
do
it
in
a
safe
way
and
practice
it
takes
repetition

This
sport
is
so
exciting
and
is
really
helpful
in
gaining
balance
working
on

stabilizing

It

Third
in
a
series
of
occasional
blogs
about
the
ever
changing
quality
of
travel
destinations
around
the
world
about
what
s
going
on
behind
the
scenes
and
how
it
affects
the
character
of
the
places
we
care
about
Hong
Kong
has
more
natural
attractions
than
Ireland
Sweden
is
culturally
richer
than
all
of
India
Eh
Welcome
to
the
world
of
economic
research
combined
in
reports
that
can
be
used
to
shape
the
places
we
love
to
visit
The
business
leaders
and
economists
who
gathered
at
the
World
Economic
Forum
recently
in
Davos
Switzerland
can
find
the
data
behind
these
startling
comparisons
in
the
Forum
s
own
500
page
Travel
Tourism
Competitiveness
Report
To
be
sure
the
report
is
a
massive
piece
of
work
wonky
but
fascinating
stuff
if
you
ve
never
looked
at
how
the
tourism
industry
thinks
The
report
s
star
feature
is
its
ratings
of
national
economies
the
Travel
and
Tourism
Competitiveness
Index
Competitiveness
is
money
speak
for
Would
your
company
want
to
build
a
hotel
there
Of
course
the
question
behind
the
question
then
has
to
be
Would
we
travelers
show
up
and
stay
in
it
And
the
winner
is
Presumably
then
the
most
competitive
countries
are
the
ones
we
would
most
enjoy
visiting
So
which
is
the
best
Of
the
139
countries
rated
in
2011
Numero
Uno
the
winner
for
the
fourth
year
running
is
Switzerland
Well
OK
Switzerland
is
certainly
pretty
good
It
s
a
beautiful
country
that
takes
excellent
care
of
itself
Coincidentally
sort
of
it
s
the
home
of
Davos
Is
it
the
most
appealing
nation
on
Earth
It
s
not
without
wrinkles
The
Swiss
franc
soared
so
high
into
the
stratosphere
at
least
until
the
Swiss
tied
it
down
to
the
euro
that
most
people
couldn
t
afford
visiting
where
an
average
restaurant
meal
for
two
could
run
200
Not
so
competitive
that
Otherwise
though
Switzerland
is
a
reasonable
winner
At
the
other
end
of
the
scale
it
s
no
surprise
either
that
impoverished
refugee
laden
Chad
anchors
the
bottom
at
No
139
The
U
S
by
the
way
comes
in
at
a
strong
number
6
despite
bombing
out
on
ease
of
entry
Just
try
to
get
a
visa
But
the
Forum
s
report
contains
some
bizarre
results
too
The
scores
are
a
composite
of
14
different
categories
each
with
its
own
sub
scores
and
they
don
t
always
add
up
Ireland
the
Emerald
Isle
ranks
112
on
natural
resources
much
lower
than
high
rise
Hong
Kong
ranked
at
68
Really
Botswana
home
of
400
a
night
eco
safaris
nevertheless
ranks
8
on
price
competitiveness
purportedly
a
much
better
deal
than
moderately
priced
Peru
at
rank
81
Sweden
ranks
first
in
cultural
resources
more
than
France
rank
10
or
all
of
polyglot
India
rank
24
How
can
this
be
The
answer
lies
in
the
use
of
metrics
that
is
the
report
relies
on
things
you
can
count
The
ranking
system
is
based
partly
on
CEO
interview
results
but
more
heavily
on
a
set
of
quantifiable
indicators
Hong
Kong
for
instance
has
a
high
percentage
of
its
tiny
land
area
under
protection
so
it
comes
out
looking
greener
than
Ireland
New
Zealand
s
vulnerable
island
ecosystem
records
the
world
s
highest
rate
of
threatened
species
probably
because
New
Zealand
actually
bothered
to
record
them
but
that
bad
number
knocks
one
of
the
world
s
most
conservation
minded
nations
downward
in
the
ranking
Why
should
we
care
Because
governments
and
investors
make
decisions
based
in
part
on
this
report
decisions
that
might
improve
a
destination
or
ruin
it
Stewardship
or
Ease
of
Business
For
comparison
look
at
the
National
Geographic
rankings
of
destinations
published
annually
in
National
Geographic
Traveler
from
2004
through
2010
We
avoided
quantifiable
measures
how
do
you
quantify
scenic
beauty
or
cultural
integrity
and
based
the
surveys
solely
on
hundreds
of
expert
opinions
as
to
each
destination
s
condition
The
results
generated
an
Index
of
Destination
Stewardship
The
2009
survey
of
destination
stewardship
National
Geographc
Traveler
November
December
To
be
sure
the
purpose
was
different
from
the
Davos
research
We
were
looking
at
sustainability
Davos
at
economics
But
the
two
do
relate
In
the
long
run
a
place
can
t
succeed
at
one
without
the
other
The
National
Geographic
surveys
polled
opinions
from
experts
with
a
stewardship
bias
The
Forum
polls
business
executives
presumably
with
an
economic
and
profit
bias
Legitimate
perceptions
from
two
different
directions
The
trouble
begins
when
they
conflict
A
higher
score
in
some
Forum
categories
may
actually
hurt
destination
quality
Ease
of
business
and
competitive
pricing
for
instance
may
mask
lax
environmental
protection
and
free
fire
zones
for
slapdash
developers
Heavy
cruise
ship
traffic
and
sprawling
vacation
subdivisions
dampen
stewardship
scores
but
economic
metrics
like
infrastructure
may
encourage
that
very
overdevelopment
Tourism
is
known
for
fouling
its
own
nest
The
once
unspoiled
destination
spoils
growing
a
rancid
crust
of
asphalt
and
fast
food
franchises
Quantify
vs
Qualify
Then
there
are
the
arithmetic
issues
The
report
does
assign
Switzerland
a
bottom
hugging
127
in
pricing
competitiveness
but
cost
of
trip
the
decision
maker
for
many
tourists
apparently
gets
no
more
weight
in
the
Index
formula
than
any
of
the
other
13
categories
While
many
numerical
measures
used
by
the
report
are
fine
some
others
are
a
bit
weird
The
Culture
category
counts
history
only
in
terms
of
a
country
s
UNESCO
listed
World
Heritage
sites
No
other
protected
historic
places
or
districts
too
hard
to
find
and
quantify
No
museums
theaters
and
performance
venues
either
The
researchers
have
tried
but
the
data
s
not
there
What
is
easy
to
count
Sport
stadium
seats
No
kidding
In
Davos
economics
one
fifth
of
the
weighting
for
a
nation
s
cultural
resource
score
is
based
on
its
stadium
capacity
That
might
make
sense
in
Texas
but
not
in
Italy
The
Human
Resources
category
includes
several
general
education
measures
fine
but
no
measure
of
local
employment
in
tourism
business
such
as
tour
guides
innkeepers
restaurant
staffs
No
reasonable
way
to
get
the
data
But
one
factor
the
Index
does
count
is
um
HIV
prevalence
Just
what
sort
of
tourism
are
we
assessing
here
Those
oddities
are
not
necessarily
the
fault
of
the
researchers
who
burned
much
late
night
oil
to
get
the
huge
report
done
Indeed
they
welcome
suggestions
for
better
measures
It
s
more
the
framing
of
the
task
in
the
first
place
For
example
quantitative
data
is
usually
tabulated
by
political
jurisdictions
Deal
with
139
of
them
and
it
s
virtually
impossible
to
get
meaningful
comparisons
against
an
international
stew
of
varying
definitions
methods
and
accuracy
If
statistically
desperate
you
re
tempted
to
grab
whatever
data
is
available
To
paraphrase
an
oft
forgotten
observation
The
quantifiable
is
not
necessarily
meaningful
nor
is
the
meaningful
always
quantifiable
We
don
t
want
economic
and
political
leaders
basing
their
decisions
about
our
favorite
destinations
on
a
foundation
of
quantified
mush
Probably
travel
and
tourism
hasn
t
been
foremost
on
the
minds
of
the
money
barons
who
gathered
at
Davos
though
it
does
constitute
by
most
measures
one
of
the
world
s
top
three
industries
And
a
country
that
I
personally
love
is
foremost
on
their
minds
Greece
Gorgeous
Greece
has
now
become
worrisome
to
visit
Its
debt
crisis
is
a
black
hole
in
the
economic
cosmos
sucking
in
massive
clouds
of
euros
and
hope
Are
more
protests
more
strikes
to
come
Greece
scores
a
robust
29
out
of
139
in
tourism
competitiveness
Go
figure
Better
yet
Davos
don
t
figure
Evaluate
instead
More
insight
and
fewer
numbers
perhaps
We
count
on
you
for
wisdom
that
will
protect
the
places
we
love

The
Masai
Mara
is
a
place
of
great
beauty
and
drama
where
people
and
wildlife
live
side
by
side
While
having
a
savannah
full
of
wildlife
on
your
doorstep
seems
amazing
to
us
living
with
lions
is
never
easy
With
the
generous
support
of
the
National
Geographic
Big
Cats
Initiative
the
Anne
K
Taylor
Fund
AKTF
team
is
helping
to
reduce
the
growing
conflict
between
humans
and
wild
animals
by
fortifying
Maasai
livestock
enclosures
or
bomas
with
wire
fencing
Anne
and
her
team
encourage
and
assist
the
local
Maasai
to
be
actively
involved
in
conservation
building
a
sense
of
trust
through
community
work
that
includes
building
schools
feeding
children
and
introducing
solar
power
Building
better
bomas
Cattle
along
with
shoats
sheep
and
goats
are
the
primary
livelihood
of
the
Maasai
who
value
livestock
above
all
else
The
risk
of
retaliatory
killings
of
marauding
lions
and
other
big
predators
is
high
when
there
is
so
much
to
lose
A
traditional
boma
made
of
thorn
trees
is
a
frail
defence
against
attack
from
predators
who
are
hungry
for
their
next
meal
or
need
to
feed
their
family
Herders
tell
us
that
they
are
often
forced
to
keep
watch
all
night
with
the
threat
of
wild
animals
lurking
just
outside
the
firelight
Fencing
livestock
enclosures
with
wire
barriers
keeps
predators
at
bay
and
livestock
safe
from
harm
Wire
fencing
provided
by
AKTF
is
used
to
fortify
the
boma
with
two
feet
underground
and
six
to
ten
feet
above
This
prevents
lions
from
pushing
through
leopards
climbing
over
and
honey
badgers
and
hyenas
digging
underneath
Herders
tell
us
that
they
can
now
sleep
peacefully
knowing
that
their
livestock
is
being
protected
At
this
time
over
two
hundred
bomas
have
been
fortified
and
the
wire
fencing
continues
to
be
100
successful
in
preventing
predation
when
it
has
been
installed
properly
A
leopard
recently
broke
into
an
unprotected
boma
where
it
decimated
a
herd
of
shoats
In
revenge
Maasai
warriors
from
the
local
village
hunted
down
the
leopard
and
shot
it
with
a
bow
and
arrow
Sadly
this
terrible
loss
on
both
sides
could
have
been
prevented
if
the
boma
had
been
fortified
The
demand
for
chainlink
fencing
is
growing
by
the
day
with
an
increasing
amount
of
requests
flooding
in
from
Maasai
livestock
owners
who
have
seen
with
their
own
eyes
the
effectiveness
of
building
better
bomas
Protection
against
poachers
The
anti
poaching
team
are
passionate
about
protecting
the
rich
and
diverse
wildlife
of
the
Masai
Mara
working
against
all
odds
to
track
down
poachers
remove
snares
and
rescue
trapped
or
injured
wildlife
from
a
slow
and
horrible
death
While
on
patrol
with
Elias
Kamande
and
his
team
we
discovered
a
poacher
camp
filled
with
old
bones
and
a
recently
slaughtered
buffalo
The
poor
animal
had
been
driven
into
a
dry
riverbed
and
speared
to
death
We
quickly
went
in
pursuit
of
the
poachers
but
unfortunately
they
escaped
into
a
nearby
forest
Secured
bomas
provide
better
protection
to
wildlife
Elias
tells
us
that
poachers
have
been
taking
advantage
of
the
heavy
rains
to
hunt
on
foot
while
the
anti
poaching
team
has
been
battling
against
terrible
road
conditions
and
knee
deep
mud
to
help
save
wild
animals
from
terrible
injuries
caused
by
snares
arrows
or
spears
Walking
back
to
the
car
we
met
a
pair
of
big
male
lions
prowling
through
the
tall
grass
With
beating
hearts
we
stood
our
ground
but
they
soon
moved
off
at
the
sight
of
us
It
was
breathtaking
to
be
so
close
to
these
magnificent
creatures
in
the
wild
an
animal
whose
very
existence
is
being
threatened
A
brighter
future
It
was
a
joy
to
visit
the
Oloomongi
school
and
see
all
of
the
happy
smiling
faces
of
the
Maasai
children
Everyone
wanted
to
be
photographed
and
a
crowd
of
eager
students
quickly
surrounded
us
The
teachers
tell
us
that
the
children
are
staying
in
school
longer
and
getting
better
grades
with
the
school
lunch
program
as
they
are
now
able
to
focus
on
their
study
without
feeling
tired
or
hungry
The
Insta
porridge
provides
the
energy
and
sustenance
they
need
to
make
it
through
the
day
The
new
classroom
after
much
hard
work
and
a
few
delays
due
to
the
heavy
rain
has
been
completed
in
time
for
the
first
term
opening
its
doors
to
many
more
children
who
will
have
a
brighter
future
through
education
Power
to
the
people
After
sunset
the
Masai
Mara
is
covered
in
a
blanket
of
darkness
except
for
the
glowing
of
firelight
from
the
inside
of
huts
Together
with
Solar
Aid
AKTF
is
bringing
renewable
energy
to
the
Maasai
using
the
power
of
the
sun
So
far
solar
systems
have
been
installed
in
two
schools
allowing
for
longer
hours
evening
classes
and
after
school
study
sessions
Solar
power
is
also
being
used
to
set
up
income
generating
activities
to
go
towards
textbooks
classroom
furniture
and
improving
school
buildings
There
is
a
high
demand
for
clean
and
affordable
light
in
the
homes
of
the
surrounding
Maasai
villages
with
part
of
the
profit
from
household
solar
going
back
into
the
feeding
program
at
the
school
Clean
cooking
Biofuel
made
out
of
cow
dung
is
another
energy
producing
project
that
has
everyone
in
the
village
talking
Rather
than
chopping
down
firewood
the
Maasai
can
produce
biogas
from
the
manure
from
their
cows
This
keeps
the
village
or
manyatta
cleaner
by
recycling
waste
and
is
much
more
eco
friendly
The
Maasai
women
tell
us
that
using
a
gas
cooker
to
prepare
food
and
boil
water
saves
them
from
having
to
walk
long
distances
in
search
of
firewood
giving
them
more
time
to
do
other
chores
and
look
after
their
children
Getting
a
green
thumb
The
women
s
horticulture
project
involves
sack
gardens
that
are
low
cost
easy
to
put
together
and
simple
to
maintain
with
a
little
care
The
vegetables
grown
this
way
add
much
needed
nutrition
to
the
traditional
Maasai
diet
of
blood
milk
and
meat
Planting
in
a
sack
prevents
wildlife
such
as
eland
buffalo
and
impala
from
raiding
the
garden
thereby
decreasing
the
risk
of
revenge
killings
by
poisoning
or
spearing
The
Maasai
women
tell
us
that
they
can
now
feed
their
children
without
worrying
that
all
their
hard
work
will
be
destroyed
Conservation
strategies
also
seek
to
educate
and
improve
the
lives
of
local
children
Ultimately
local
people
must
benefit
from
healthy
ecosystems
Cultural
craftwork
The
women
s
beading
project
led
by
Joseph
Mpatiany
and
his
wife
Regina
provides
much
needed
work
and
community
support
while
following
a
tradition
that
has
lasted
for
generations
passed
on
from
mother
to
daughter
Maasai
women
from
different
villages
come
together
to
make
brightly
coloured
hand
beaded
bracelets
in
intricate
patterns
This
beautiful
beadwork
is
then
sold
to
individuals
and
FEED
projects
which
in
turn
feeds
millions
of
children
in
Kenya
and
elsewhere
through
the
UN
World
Food
Programme
Yearn
to
learn
AKTF
also
conducts
adult
education
classes
including
English
mathematics
and
Kiswahili
along
with
lessons
on
how
to
run
a
small
business
Enoch
Mobisa
who
runs
the
classes
tells
us
that
the
teaching
embraces
the
Maasai
way
of
life
while
encouraging
the
community
to
adapt
to
modern
day
Kenya
Care
for
the
community
At
the
heart
of
all
the
wonderful
work
done
by
Anne
and
her
team
lies
the
importance
of
saving
wildlife
The
local
lion
pride
has
just
welcomed
a
new
litter
of
cubs
that
is
heart
warming
to
see
Protecting
livestock
enclosures
to
prevent
predation
and
the
resultant
retaliatory
killings
gives
these
lions
a
better
chance
of
survival
Community
support
is
essential
for
the
success
of
the
boma
project
which
is
why
AKTF
is
so
active
in
the
local
community
Working
together
with
the
Maasai
is
the
only
way
to
bring
about
real
and
lasting
change
and
in
doing
so
protect
the
big
cats

Chance

Venus

Credit
Starry

Thanks
to
a
close
encounter
with
Venus
skywatchers
the
next
few
nights
get
a
chance
to
easily
glimpse
the
7th
planet
from
the
Sun
the
green
giant
Uranus
While
the
pair
of
planets
will
be
visible
together
within
the
field
of
view
of
any
standard
7
50
binocular
until
Feb
15th
Venus
and
Uranus
will
have
their
closest
encounter
for
2012
on
the
10th
at
2
oo
UT
9
pm
EST
making
it
well
positioned
for
North
American
observers
in
the
evening
of
Feb
9th
The
two
worlds
will
only
be
separated
by
0
3
degrees
less
than
the
width
of
the
moon
s
disk
in
the
sky
Shining
at
magnitude
5
9
Uranus
is
technically
visible
to
the
naked
eye
as
a
superfaint
bluish
star
but
that
s
really
only
possible
from
very
dark
skies
far
from
city
lights
So
what
this
means
for
most
of
us
is
that
we
need
at
least
binoculars
to
catch
sight
of
it
Through
a
small
telescope
under
medium
to
high
magnification
it
really
looks
distinctively
like
a
bonafide
planet
with
its
tiny
blue
green
disk
By
the
way
it
s
the
absorption
of
red
light
by
methane
in
its
atmosphere
that
gives
Uranus
it
s
cool
cyan
coloring
Start
your
hunt
by
facing
the
west
southwest
horizon
at
local
dusk
and
zero
in
on
beacon
like
Venus
the
brightest
starlike
object
in
the
evening
sky
Then
with
your
binoculars
or
a
small
telescope
look
for
a
tiny
faint
blue
green
dot
to
the
left
of
Venus
And
remember
if
you
do
get
clouded
for
the
main
show
on
the
9th
then
you
can
still
catch
the
pair
for
a
few
days
after
as
Venus
quickly
leaves
behind
the
green
planet
rising
higher
in
the
western
sky
First
spotted
in
1781
Uranus
was
the
first
new
planet
discovered
since
ancient
times
however
it
wasn
t
until
NASA
s
Voyager
2
flew
by
in
1986
that
we
got
an
up
close
view
at
the
third
largest
planet
in
the
solar
system
4
times
the
width
of
Earth
It
s
so
far
away
from
the
Sun
that
if
you
were
a
Uranian
you
would
be
lucky
to
celebrate
your
first
birthday
A
single
year
on
this
planet
the
time
it
takes
to
make
one
orbit
around
the
Sun
lasts
just
about
a
human
lifespan
84
years
Sitting
at
a
whopping
3
1
billion
km
from
Earth
Uranus
great
distance
means
that
it
takes
the
sun
light
reflecting
off
its
upper
cloud
deck
2
hours
and
52
minutes
to
reach
your
eye
Just
a
little
something
to
think
about
when
gazing
at
that
tiny
green
dot
in
the
sky
Skywatching
Extra
After
about
9
pm
local
time
on
Feb
9th
face
the
eastern
horizon
and
watch
the
waning
gibbous
moon
hang
lower
right
of
orange
colored
Mars
The
cosmic
duo
will
be
10
degrees
apart
equal
to
the
width
of
your
fist
held
at
arm
s
length

Bushmeat
Every

Some
call
it
the
African
silence
when
a
forest
is
struck
silent
by
poaching
and
the
bushmeat
trade
Others
call
this
phenomenon
dead
zones
that
have
no
birds
no
monkeys
no
small
mammals
no
snakes
These
places
have
been
stripped
bare
by
local
communities
that
are
struggling
to
feed
their
families
and
access
medical
care
The
Mbuti
pygmy
encampments
photographed
in
the
early
1980s
depict
a
wire
and
nylon
free
lifestyle
that
saw
them
capture
forest
animals
on
a
daily
basis
for
local
consumption
Today
most
of
the
bushmeat
is
exported
to
distant
markets
by
bicycle
4
4
vehicles
and
on
foot
No
one
has
the
right
to
judge
these
people
when
they
focus
on
bushmeat
as
their
only
source
of
protein
We
must
however
restrict
use
of
forest
products
as
far
as
possible
to
people
with
heritage
rights
to
the
land
as
they
are
the
custodians
of
these
forests
Terese
and
John
Hart
are
committed
to
witnessing
studying
conserving
and
combatting
the
atrocities
of
the
bushmeat
trade
in
the
Democratic
Republic
of
Congo
Over
the
next
few
weeks
I
will
post
a
series
of
summary
posts
linking
back
to
their
blogs
on
their
website

It
was
not
until
1929
that
anatomists
realized
that
there
was
an
ape
enough
like
the
chimpanzee
to
be
Pan
but
different
enough
to
be
a
new

Until
the
Forest
is
Empty
In
some
of
DR
Congo
s
most
remote
forest
we
are
witnessing
a
cascading
clean
out
of
large
wildlife
It
is
like
watching
a
cloud
shadow
creep
over
the
forest
where
it
passes
it
leaves
an
invisible
permanent
absence
The
edge
is
pushed
forward
by
an
advancing
web
of
hunter
s
paths
crisscrossed
with
long
snare
lines

litter
of
shotgun
cartridges
and

a

A
park
has
local

national
authority
for
protection
Still
infrastructure
and
enforcement
will
take
funds
and
now
in
DRCongo
these
funds
must
come
from
overseas
Perhaps

Not
to
celebrate

to

still

and
hopefully
will

Supply
and
Demand
on
the
Colorado
River
Source
USBR
Much
ado
has
been
made
in
recent
headlines
about
growing
scarcity
on
the
Colorado
River
Water
supply
as
reflected
by
what
s
left
in
storage
in
the
basin
s
big
reservoirs
has
dropped
from
full
just
over
a
decade
ago
to
64
today
and
the
river
hasn
t
run
regularly
to
the
sea
since
the
90
s
While
some
water
users
have
the
legal
right
to
extract
more
water
from
the
basin
it
is
evident
that
by
adding
new
demands
to
this
over
used
system
we
will
create
shortages
somewhere
else
The
federal
Bureau
of
Reclamation
has
started
working
with
the
seven
states
in
the
basin
AZ
CA
CO
NM
NV
UT
and
WY
to
study
the
future
of
supply
and
demand
on
the
Colorado
and
to
search
for
solutions
that
fill
the
gap
between
them
as
illustrated
in
the
right
hand
side
of
the
graph
above
Stay
tuned
for
great
debates
about
the
merits
of
cloud
seeding
versus
conservation
and
desalinization
versus
re
use
But
what
strikes
me
as
most
promising
is
the
commitment
from
Reclamation
and
the
states
to
consider
the
health
of
the
basin
s
rivers
Their
latest
report
discusses
how
they
will
assess
the
future
status
of
ecosystem
health
by
looking
at
projected
conditions
for
endangered
species
river
based
wildlife
refuges
and
even
for
a
host
of
freshwater
and
riparian
habitats
on
the
mainstem
and
major
tributaries
They
draw
the
connection
between
the
health
of
the
river
and
the
health
of
the
economy
not
only
by
measuring
how
well
consumptive
water
demands
can
be
met
in
all
sectors
but
also
by
discussing
how
they
ll
measure
future
flows
from
the
boater
s
perspective
and
how
recreation
based
economies
may
fare
That
a
study
of
the
future
of
the
Colorado
should
include
the
health
of
the
river
itself
might
seem
obvious
Yet
the
vast
system
of
pipes
and
canals
we
ve
built
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
this
basin
point
to
the
Colorado
s
central
importance
as
a
water
supply
to
the
arid
Southwest
and
too
often
we
overlook
the
river
itself
How
else
can
we
explain
the
damage
we
have
done
to
so
many
of
the
basin
s
rivers
over
the
last
half
century
The
future
of
this
region
promises
to
be
more
crowded
and
likely
hotter
and
drier
but
that
doesn
t
have
to
spell
the
death
of
the
Colorado
River
Reclamation
and
the
states
are
facing
the
need
to
make
decisions
of
great
consequence
about
how
to
supply
and
manage
water
use
in
every
sector
Let
s
hope
their
new
commitment
to
look
at
impacts
on
the
river
gives
them
the
wisdom
to
forge
a
path
forward
that
meets
our
legitimate
water
needs
and
protects
and
restores
healthy
flows

Maldives
leader
Mohamed
Nasheed
called
the
world
s
most
environmentally
outspoken
president
because
of
his
calls
for
drastically
cutting
greenhouse
gas
emissions
was
forced
to
resign
at
gunpoint
he
claimed
He
had
used
stunts
such
as
an
underwater
cabinet
meeting
to
highlight
his
island
nation
s
vulnerability
to
sea
level
rise
His
resignation
followed
weeks
of
protests
and
was
apparently
motivated
by
internal
politics
unrelated
to
his
environmental
views
Global
Warming
behind
Europe
s
Winter
Global
warming
could
be
behind
the
Arctic
blast
that
recently
hit
Europe
killing
more
than
200
The
unusually
small
ice
cover
over
the
Kara
and
Barents
Seas
has
changed
wind
patterns
pushing
frigid
air
into
Europe
Meanwhile
most
of
the
U
S
has
been
enjoying
an
especially
mild
winter
although
Alaska
has
had
one
of
the
coldest
and
snowiest
on
record
and
the
Bering
Sea
s
ice
grew
to
its
second
highest
on
record
in
January
Meteorologist
Jeffrey
Masters
said
it
s
not
clear
if
global
warming
is
the
culprit
behind
the
U
S
weather
but
over
the
last
couple
of
years
it
s
really
not
the
atmosphere
I
know
anymore
When
the
Los
Angeles
Times
reported
on
the
warm
winter
without
mentioning
the
possible
influence
of
global
warming
climate
scientist
Michael
Mann
called
it
journalistic
malpractice
However
the
media
is
too
often
the
scapegoat
with
politicians
and
the
economy
having
a
bigger
influence
on
public
opinion
about
climate
change
according
to
a
new
study
Fracking
Study
Raises
Greenhouse
Gas
Worries
A
new
study
which
sampled
the
air
around
sites
where
hydraulic
fracturing
is
being
used
to
extract
natural
gas
from
shale
revealed
more
gases
mainly
methane
escape
into
the
air
than
previously
thought
Although
natural
gas
is
usually
touted
as
being
better
for
the
climate
than
other
fossil
fuels
the
study
indicated
these
leaks
could
erase
much
of
that
benefit
Geoengineering
Gets
More
Scrutiny
Tycoons
including
Bill
Gates
and
Richard
Branson
have
funded
research
and
reports
on
geoengineering
proposed
planetary
scale
projects
to
fight
climate
change
raising
concerns
about
the
power
of
vested
interests
Research
into
geoengineering
is
a
small
but
fast
growing
field
One
recent
study
found
that
sunlight
blocking
particles
could
cool
the
planet
but
would
change
regional
climate
patterns
so
would
not
be
able
to
keep
the
climate
as
it
is
now
Another
recent
study
found
that
such
geoengineering
could
help
food
production
by
limiting
heat
stress
while
retaining
the
boost
in
growth
from
higher
CO2
levels
Wind
Power
Struggles
Ahead
Wind
turbine
installations
in
2011
were
up
6
percent
over
the
year
before
a
slight
increase
compared
with
the
rapid
growth
before
the
2008
recession
Less
than
half
of
the
installations
were
in
Europe
or
North
America
and
Asia
led
the
growth
The
world
s
largest
turbine
manufacturer
Denmark
based
Vestas
Wind
Systems
has
been
flagging
it
lost
220
million
in
2011
four
times
more
than
expected
and
a
number
of
senior
officers
left
most
recently
the
chairman
In
the
U
S
wind
power
advocates
have
been
fighting
for
offshore
turbines
along
the
Atlantic
for
decades
and
now
the
federal
government
is
aiming
to
speed
permits
after
a
positive
environmental
review
Secretary
of
the
Interior
Ken
Salazar
said
We
ll
have
those
leases

by
the
end
of
2012
Hair
No
But
Grass
Yes
Reports
from
a
few
years
ago
that
Nepalese
teenagers
made
a
solar
panel
from
hair
was
apparently
a
hoax
but
now
MIT
researchers
have
done
something
that
seems
equally
unlikely
making
solar
panels
from
grass
clippings
The
new
study
described
how
to
fairly
cheaply
isolate
a
key
part
of
the
molecular
machinery
behind
photosynthesis
and
then
apply
it
to
a
metal
or
glass
surface
to
create
a
photovoltaic
panel
The
researchers
are
trying
to
make
it
simple
enough
that
anyone
can
hack
together
a
solar
panel
using
grass
clippings
and
a
bag
of
cheap
chemical
powder

In
a
sweltering
tin
shed
on
the
outskirts
of
Hanoi
20
Asiatic
black
bears
pant
with
thirst
and
gaze
with
despair
through
cage
bars
as
they
await
the
next
onslaught
of
bile
extraction
agony
During
this
crude
process
they
will
be
subdued
tied
down
and
will
have
long
needles
jabbed
into
their
abdomens
numerous
times
until
the
gall
bladder
is
located
and
their
bile
extracted
Given
that
this
farm
is
reportedly
one
of
the
more
humane
there
may
be
the
luxury
of
a
portable
ultrasound
machine
used
to
locate
their
gallbladder
thus
sparing
them
the
random
multiple
needle
jabs
commonly
used
in
the
more
hit
and
miss
method
of
bile
extraction
Asiatic
black
bears
or
moon
bears
as
they
are
known
because
of
the
distinctive
yellow
crescent
shaped
marking
on
their
chests
produce
bile
with
the
highest
amount
of
ursodeoxycholic
acid
UDCA
It
is
thought
that
the
bears
produce
the
bile
as
a
natural
protection
for
their
liver
and
to
prevent
gallstones
and
other
illnesses
during
the
long
period
of
hibernation
The
bile
is
reputed
to
cure
everything
from
bruises
to
cancer
and
is
notably
regarded
and
consumed
as
a
libido
enhancing
tonic
This
makes
the
bears
and
their
bile
a
valuable
business
commodity
and
a
target
Bear
bile
farming
is
illegal
in
Vietnam
and
the
Moon
bear
is
listed
internationally
as
a
critically
endangered
species
but
this
has
not
halted
or
even
slowed
the
rampant
trade
The
bile
sells
for
exorbitant
amounts
and
that
means
for
many
Vietnamese
farmers
giving
up
the
bears
they
have
trapped
from
the
wild
is
not
an
option
For
people
such
as
Animals
Asia
Vietnam
director
Dr
Tuan
Bendixsen
the
situation
is
untenable
and
his
bid
to
save
the
bears
has
become
his
life
s
work
The
farmers
we
visited
as
part
of
this
documentary
have
had
these
40
bears
as
pets
for
several
years
now
In
2007
when
the
Vietnamese
government
first
introduced
bear
keeping
regulations
those
who
had
micro
chipped
bears
were
allowed
to
keep
them
but
had
to
abide
by
regulations
that
meant
it
was
illegal
to
extract
bile
sell
it
or
any
other
bear
product
They
could
not
advertise
bile
or
bear
products
or
engage
in
any
other
sort
of
trade
The
gate
keeping
process
around
these
regulations
is
not
upheld
and
that
leaves
all
stakeholders
in
limbo
Bendixsen
has
been
negotiating
unsuccessfully
for
years
with
the
owners
of
these
bears
appealing
to
have
the
bears
surrendered
so
they
can
be
taken
to
the
purpose
built
sanctuary
at
Tam
Dao
about
two
hour
s
drive
above
Hanoi
The
sanctuary
provides
a
respite
for
abused
and
damaged
bears
rescued
by
Animals
Asia
from
farms
like
this
one
The
Animals
Asia
Foundation
is
a
not
for
profit
organization
and
relies
exclusively
on
donations
and
sponsorship
At
present
they
have
rescued
close
to
100
but
there
are
still
an
estimated
4
000
bears
on
farms
throughout
Vietnam
trapped
in
cramped
cages
starved
dehydrated
and
suffering
repeated
bile
extractions
For
most
this
is
the
only
life
they
have
ever
known

misinformed
citizens
cause
harm
to
endangered
species
All
across
the
world
we
see
species
being
decimated
to
make
traditional
medicines
which
actually
do
nothing
to

Our
maps
have
long
been
known
for
their
distinctive
typefaces
But
few
outside
the
Society
know
little
of
the
history
that
lies
behind
them
Until
the
early
1930s
most
of
our
maps
were
hand
lettered
a
slow
and
tedious
process
requiring
great
patience
and
even
greater
skill
An
alternate
process
that
of
setting
names
in
movable
type
pulling
an
impression
on
gummed
paper
that
was
then
pasted
down
on
the
map
often
yielded
less
than
durable
or
clearly
readable
type
The
Society
s
first
Chief
Cartographer
Albert
H
Bumstead
believed
the
answer
lied
in
photo
graphic
type
Laboring
long
hours
in
his
home
workshop
he
discovered
that
existing
typefaces
did
not
lend
themselves
to
Society
standards
our
map
enlargement
and
reduction
factors
often
caused
small
hairline
letters
to
break
up
while
larger
block
letters
tended
to
fill
up
To
this
end
he
invented
a
machine
for
composing
map
type
photographically
that
ultimately
improved
overall
type
legibility
Once
this
photolettering
process
was
refined
it
was
applied
to
our
United
States
map
supplement
in
the
May
1933
National
Geographic
Shortly
thereafter
Society
cartographer
Charles
E
Riddiford
was
tasked
with
designing
typefaces
with
much
improved
photomechanical
reproductive
qualities
He
devised
a
set
so
attractive
and
legible
that
these
typefaces
are
still
used
in
a
digital
format
today
These
patented
fonts
were
designed
with
the
purpose
of
reflecting
as
well
as
accentuating
designated
map
features
If
you
study
our
reference
maps
and
atlases
closely
it
s
quite
evident
that
every
feature
is
asso
ciated
with
a
specific
typeface
Color
and
typographic
weight
from
light
to
bold
further
adds
to
this
distinction

These
people
work
hard
out
here
the
conservationists
the
farmers
everyone
The
hot
days
of
October
dictate
an
early
rise
to
reach
the
far
flung
locations
that
entail
research
data
gathering
and
community
outreach
I
m
in
the
central
Kalahari
region
just
outside
the
town
of
Ghanzi
in
Botswana
It
s
hot
like
Africa
hot
as
the
clich
goes
Cheetah
Conservation
Botswana
CCB
has
a
camp
here
where
a
small
permanent
staff
of
six
and
two
volunteers
reside
as
well
as
the
giant
guard
dog
Murphy
and
Cat
a
small
orange
house
cat
with
a
taste
for
murdering
smaller
creatures
Murphy
after
a
roll
in
the
mud
on
a
hot
day
In
the
night
jackals
can
be
heard
and
Murphy
sets
to
barking
his
head
off
and
growling
at
them
The
jackal
population
has
increased
dramatically
according
to
local
Afrikaner
farmers
and
as
a
result
they
are
suffering
losses
of
small
livestock
sheep
and
goat
This
brings
them
into
direct
conflict
with
the
predators
in
the
region
If
they
hunt
the
jackal
it
could
trigger
a
crisis
in
the
pack
and
thus
they
will
breed
even
more
So
what
are
they
supposed
to
do
protect
their
flocks
from
intense
losses
CCB
Researcher
Jane
Horgan
is
working
on
just
this
issue
Livestock
dogs
such
as
our
Murphy
an
Anatolian
Shepherd
local
Botswana
mix
breeds
and
greyhound
mixes
are
being
tested
at
CCB
Ghanzi
camp
and
elsewhere
as
to
their
effectiveness
in
this
particular
climate
of
dry
intense
heat
Today
I
m
in
the
car
with
Jane
We
re
in
the
ever
sturdy
Toyota
Hilux
taking
us
over
the
bumpiest
roads
I
ve
ever
experienced
Driving
through
dust
and
fences
Being
in
the
passenger
seat
means
that
I
m
on
fence
duty
We
re
in
farmland
game
farms
and
livestock
farms
and
that
means
gates
and
lots
of
em
I
open
and
close
nearly
a
dozen
gates
throughout
the
day
Some
farmers
work
with
CCB
allowing
them
to
study
play
trees
on
their
land
collect
scat
and
set
camera
traps
to
analyze
the
cheetah
population
and
its
integral
part
in
the
ecosystem
We
are
checking
play
trees
on
the
Flattery
s
farm
the
term
given
to
trees
with
low
branches
that
cheetah
love
to
scratch
mark
spray
and
hang
about
There
is
scat
to
collect
and
batteries
in
the
motion
sensor
cameras
to
change
A
lot
of
cheetah
are
in
the
area
as
evidenced
by
fresh
scat
and
lots
of
fabulous
self
portraits
on
the
cameras
I
may
as
well
retire
as
a
photographer
the
cheetah
do
it
all
on
they
re
own
with
compositional
style
and
finesse
image
on
loan
from
Cheetah
Conservation
Botswana
As
we
finish
with
the
last
marking
tree
we
drive
past
the
main
farmhouse
where
brothers
Melcomb
and
Quinton
are
sitting
under
a
shady
umbrella
having
a
rest
We
get
out
to
chat
and
catch
up
The
farmhouse
is
a
lovely
set
of
small
buildings
gardens
and
cages
with
exotic
birds
a
few
meerkats
three
exuberant
dogs
and
somewhere
lurking
about
is
a
pet
mongoose
Melcomb
and
Quinton
kindly
agree
to
a
video
interview
and
go
into
great
detail
about
their
relationship
with
the
predators
on
their
land
Melcomb
Quinton
on
the
quad
bike
in
search
of
the
sheep
carcass
As
we
talk
Quinton
looks
over
my
head
and
into
the
distance
Then
Melcomb
does
the
same
What
is
it
Vulture
Seconds
later
more
vulture
s
circling
in
the
distant
sky
They
know
something
is
up
their
sheep
are
in
that
direction
Quinton
sets
off
on
the
quad
bike
to
have
a
look
Minutes
later
he
radios
his
brother
a
sheep
has
been
killed
Jane
and
I
jump
in
the
truck
and
follow
the
brothers
into
the
bush
to
find
the
sheep
After
a
few
minutes
of
looking
around
in
the
thick
bush
the
unmistakable
sound
of
thousands
of
swarming
flies
lead
us
to
a
ravaged
sheep
carcass
Although
it
is
a
fresh
kill
from
that
morning
there
is
not
much
left
of
it
Quinton
says
it
s
the
work
of
three
jackals
that
killed
another
sheep
just
days
before
Jane
Melcomb
and
Quinton
point
out
the
tell
tale
signs
of
a
jackal
kill
specific
bite
marks
and
methods
of
taking
down
prey
An
air
of
resignation
takes
hold
of
the
scene
taking
a
look
at
the
evidence
I
ask
Melcomb
if
he
will
hunt
the
jackals
Yes
he
answers
Quinton
throws
the
carcass
into
a
nearby
tree
so
the
hyenas
can
t
get
to
it
and
come
back
looking
for
more
thereby
creating
a
bigger
problem
What
was
a
fairly
relaxed
chat
about
human
predator
relations
turned
into
a
visceral
example
of
the
harsh
realities
of
being
a
farmer
in
Botswana
But
there
are
solutions
that
can
mitigate
losses
Namely
livestock
dogs
for
smaller
animals
such
as
goats
sheep
and
calves
Melcomb
Quinton
and
Jane
talk
in
earnest
about
getting
a
dog
to
guard
the
sheep
With
more
jackals
in
the
area
there
are
more
mouths
to
feed
It
s
important
to
take
a
stronger
action
I
m
new
to
this
topic
listen
with
an
open
mind
and
wonder
about
the
efforts
of
hunting
and
energy
expended
considering
all
the
work
basic
farming
involves
vs
livestock
guard
dog
solutions
The
Flatterys
have
been
working
this
land
for
three
generations
and
they
are
curious
about
new
methods
but
they
also
have
a
farm
to
run
and
new
methods
take
time
Building
strong
relationships
with
the
farmers
who
already
allow
CCB
to
set
up
motion
capture

How
disappointing
I
would
have
been
upset
if
I
hadn
t
gotten
this
book
for
free
It
is
NOT
a
book
of
swashbuckling
fantasy
each
entry
is
a
short
sample
of
a
much
longer
piece
If
you
just
want

if
a
piece
is
interesting
then
this
might

you

What
s
this
This
review
is
from
Swashbuckling
Fantasy
Kindle
Edition
I
am
NOT
a
fan
of
samples
So
with
that
said
when
I
read
in
the
description
that
it
was
a
sampling
of
10
series
from
good
authors
I
almost
passed
it
by
But
then
I
thought
it
s
free
and
why
not
I
have
been
finishing
some
series
that
I
have
loved
but
they
have
come
to
an
end
and
I
have
been
looking
for
new
ones
to
start
So
for
me
this
was
neat
because
I
got
a
few
chapters
of
10
stories
to
see
if
I
liked
and
for
free
Although
most
I
had
heard
of
the
first
one
of
Jolly
was
new
to
me
I
didn
t
think
I
would
really
like
it
being
that
the
only
seeming
thing
for
her
was
she
could
run
or
walk
on
water
But
the
pirate
theme
got
to
me
and
I
enjoyed
it
Being
able
to
jump
into
multiple
series
and
see
the
different
writing
styles
perspectives
storylines
and
plots
was
nice
and
made
for
a
good
read
Although
I
didn
t
get
excited
about
any
of
them
in
particular
I
liked
looking
at
them
as
short
stories
All
in
all
it
was
a
pleasant
read
and
for
anyone
shopping
for
new
series
then
I
would
definitely
recommend

Muslin
Clamps
Pack
of
6
Tools
Hardware
These
clamps
are
sturdy
and
handle
heavy
volume
with
no
problems
Ignore
any
other
comments
claiming
that
these
are
cheap
or
poorly
made
I
am
a
portrait
photographer
and
am
constantly
taking
backdrops
down
and
putting
them
up
before
and
during
a
shoot
These
clamps
have
never
slipped
or
broken
even
though
I
usually
attach
and
reattach
them
quickly
during
shoots
They
ARE
plastic
but
it
is
a
strong
and
rugged
type
of
plastic
that
won
t
break
if
used
correctly
In
addition
the
orange
teeth
do
an
excellent
job
of
assuring
grip
The
price
is
right
as
well
Buy
them
already
and
worry
about
more
important
things

Muslin
Clamps
Pack
of
6
Tools
Hardware
I
m
ordering
my
second
batch
because
they
are
so
handy
I
m
a
photographer
and
I
don
t
really
use
them
to
hold
up
muslin
but
I
have
a
lot
of
paper
backdrops
and
I
use
them
to
keep
the
rolls
tight
for
storage
they
don
t
ruin
the
paper
Also
I
use
the
clamps
to
hold
these
backdrops
to
foam
boards
and
my
backdrop
stand
Normal
metal
clams
indent
the
foam
board
and
ruin
these
drops
I
use
them
all
the
time
to
clamp
anything
shears
to
a
curtain
rod
again
they
are
very
very
handy
to
have
around

Muslin
Clamps
Pack
of
6
Tools
Hardware
They
work
well
and
are
priced
accordingly
Compact
Strong
grip
Recommended
for
grasping
pipe
sizes
from
3
4
inch
to
1
1
4
inches
in
diameter
Tips
of
clamp
adapt
to
create
nice
a
grip
on
flat
object
Cheap
enough
that
if
you
lose
them
you
just
buy
another
pack
I
ordered
6
packs
just
because
I
m
always
losing
these
things

I
ordered
a
9
because
of
the
measurements
given
in
the
sizing
chart
I
had
to
return
the
9
and
get
an
8
1
2
because
the
9
was
way
too
big
The
shoes
are
super
cute
and
very
good
quality
I
am
very
excited
to
wear
them
when
I
go
out
with
my
husband
for
our
first
date
after
his
return
from
Afghanistan

These

are
beautiful
very
high
quality
looking
and
classy
I
was
a
bit
nervous
about
an
animal
print
pump
as
so
many
of
them
look
a
bit
trashy
in
my
opinion
but
these
are
sophisticated
and
add
a
nice
touch
to
a
work
outfit
I
love
them

These

looks

nice
and

I
gave
them
4
stars
because
the
heel
is
a

wide
I
plan
on
getting
a

mainly
got
these
because
they
were
inexpensive
and
fit
over
my
glasses
I
can
t
see
much
without
my
glasses
and
I
need
them
on
for
the
machine
shop
work
for
which
I
purchased
this
product
My
only
real
complaint
is
that
they
don
t
have
any
venting
as
a
result
after
not
that
lengthy
periods
of
use
they
tend
to
fog
up
inside
This
is
easily
fixed
by
taking
them
off
briefly
and
perhaps
wiping
down
the
inside
It
s
just
somewhat
annoying
to
have
to
stop
what
I
m
doing
every
15
minutes
or
so
to
de
fog

What
s
this
This
review
is
from
AO
Safety

Tekk

Chemical
Splash
Goggle
Tools
Home
Improvement
I
work
in
a
chemistry
lab
and
wear
goggles
anywhere
from
four
to
twelve
hours
a
day
five
to
six
days
a
week
Common
splash
goggles
become
uncomfortable
after
a
few
hours
so
I
decided
to
try
a
few
better
quality
goggles
I
wear
glasses
On
the
plus
side
these
AO
Safety
goggles
are
comfortable
The
single
piece
lens
is
flexible
and
exhibits
very
little
distortion
The
goggles
readily
conform
to
the
face
make
a
good
seal
and
are
plush
The
strap
appears
durable
On
the
minus
side
the
lens
is
tinted
the
goggles
are
heavy
the
lens
pushes
against
my
glasses
and
they
emit
a
horrific
odor
Although
the
lens
is
obviously
high
quality
it
is
tinted
The
tinting
is
subtle
but
became
more
obvious
as
time
went
by
The
goggles
are
obviously
intended
for
working
in
a
chemical
hazard
environment
Most
such
environments
are
indoors
so
there
s
really
no
logic
to
the
tint
It
s
not
dark
enough
for
full
sun
protection
and
diminishes
the
apparent
indoor
light
Compared
to
other
goggles
they
are
heavy
The
strap
keeps
them
well
positioned
as
does
the
seal
they
make
to
the
face
But
after
a
few
hours
of
wear
they
become
wearisome
from
the
weight
pulling
on
the
face
The
goggles
ability
to
conform
to
the
face
makes
them
unsuitable
for
glasses
wearers
The
edges
of
the
goggles
take
a
sharp
turn
around
the
temples
The
arms
of
my
glasses
contact
the
lens
forcing
the
glasses
into
the
bridge
of
my
nose
I
don
t
have
big
glasses
There
are
cut
outs
for
the
arms
of
glasses
which
are
readily
removed
with
an
hobby
knife
These
glasses
stink
After
removing
the
goggles
I
could
smell
the
chemicals
that
leached
from
their
manufacture
This
odor
remained
with
me
for
two
to
three
hours
Whatever
is
causing
the
odor
cannot
be
good
for
the
health
Also
as
a
chemist
odors
are
one
clue
that
something
bad
is
in
the
air
Since
the
odor
from
the
goggles
was
so
overpowering
the
inability
to
smell
lab
chemicals
is
a
safety
hazard
I
cannot
say
whether
or
not
they
are
fog
proof
or
fog
resistant
The
lab
is
kept
air
conditioned
I
can
see
why
some
occasional
goggle
users
would
like
these
especially
if
the
use
is
for
periods
less
than
one
hour
For
full
time
lab
workers
they
are
not
suitable

Tools
Home
Improvement
The
goggle
works
great
as
described
and
as
it
s
intended
to
be
used
The
lenses
are
100
anti
fog
that
is
for
sure
but
ventilation
is
bad
2
minutes
and
my
prescription
glasses
would
fog
up
and
I
d
have
to
remove
the
goggle
for
5
seconds
to
get
clear
visibility
and
this
is
why
I
rated
it
4
It
s
NOT
comfy
as
not
wearing
that
s
for
sure
but
this
is
what
you
get
for
a
well
secure
goggle
although
can
be
improved
Overall
as
an
amateur
I
m
very
glad
about
this
product

for
Clicker

Misc
The
biggest
contributing
factor
for
me
purchasing
this
particular
clicker
was
because
it
states
it
can
be
clicked
from
nearly
any
position
In
the
times
I
ve
used
it
so
far
that
is
always
the
case
It
is
very
easy
to
hold
in
my
hand
I
m
only
5
1
and
have
small
hands
for
an
average
female
and
click
in
my
palm
It
is
the
perfect
loudness
for
my
two
cats
even
though
one
typically
does
not
like
sudden
noises
I
like
that
this
clicker
has
a
section
on
the
end
for
a
key
chain
or
string
if
you
choose
to
use
one
Thus
far
I
find
no
negatives
about
this
clicker

A
must
have
for
any
Aerosmith
fan
September
29
2002
By

Utah

This
review
is
from
Box
of
Fire
Audio
CD
This
set
contains
all
12
of
Aerosmith
s
early
Columbia
releases
7
studio
albums
3
live
ones
an
early
Greatest
Hits
and
the
album
Gems
which
I
guess
is
another
anthology
For
many
fans
of
their
newer
music
few
of
these
tracks
will
be
recognizable
maybe
only
a
few
from
the
Greatest
hits
Still
this
is
a
great
way
to
discover
Aerosmith
at
their
height
Besides
the
12
original
albums
this
set
includes
a
5
track
bonus
disc
most
notable
for
its
rockin
rendition
of
Sweet
Emotion
and
the
absolutely
beautiful
version
of
Dream
On
with
a
symphony
These
are
two
excellent
remakes
of
a
couple
of
Aerosmith
s
best
songs
The
great
thing
about
this
set
is
that
all
the
old
albums
appear
exactly
as
they
originally
did
though
they
ve
been
remastered
You
don
t
have
to
worry
about
song
selection
because
it
s
all
here
So
for
anyone
wanting
to
start
a
good
Aerosmith
collection
this
is
the
absolute
best
place
to
start
This
box
set
is
highly
recommended
Don
t
let
the
high
price
tag
fool
you
it
s
well
worth
every
penny

All
the
great
old
Aerosmith
albums
Bulk
is
cheap
but
perhaps
overkill
too
December

This
review
is
from
Box
of
Fire
Audio
CD
A
lot
of
other
reviewers
here
seem
clueless
as
to
why
this
box
set
was
released
the
way
it
was
Some
history
might
clear
this
up
Aerosmith
first
signed
with
Columbia
records
in
1972
Then
in
the
mid
1980s
they
cleaned
up
their
drug
habits
and
switched
labels
to
Geffen
records
After
having
quite
a
successful
come
back
they
then
went
back
to
Columbia
records
in
1994
What
does
this
have
to
do
with
the
box
set
Well
you
have
to
realize
that
in
the
music
industry
the
release
of
compilations
box
sets
and
even
just
re
releases
of
older
albums
is
all
largely
determined
by
a
band
s
record
label
A
record
label
obviously
isn
t
going
to
make
money
off
of
an
album
put
out
by
another
label
This
means
that
when
a
band
releases
a
lot
of
albums
under
one
record
label
but
then
leaves
them
for
a
new
label
each
label
will
handle
things
with
their
own
best
interest
in
mind
For
example
the
old
stuff
might
get
acquired
and
re
released
on
and
by
the
new
label
or
the
band
will
try
to
finish
off
their
old
contract
by
releasing
a
compilation
album
etc
It
s
no
coincidence
then
that
when
Aerosmith
joined
back
with
Columbia
in
1994
the
label
decided
to
re
release
all
12
albums
that
they
had
done
for
Aerosmith
In
addition
to
selling
them
separately
they
also
decided
to
put
all
12
discs
in
this
box
set
Box
of
Fire
So
this
box
set
simply
contains
all
12
individual
Aerosmith
albums
that
had
been
released
up
until
then
with
Columbia
records
plus
a
bonus
EP
of
rarities
This
means
you
will
NOT
find
anything
from
the
albums
Aerosmith
did
with
Geffen
That
means
nothing
from
Done
With
Mirrors
Permanent
Vacation
Pump
or
Get
a
Grip
If
you
re
looking
for
a
compilation
of
the
hit
songs
from
those
years
try
Big
Ones
which
Geffen
released
in
the
same
year
But
here
is
what
you
WILL
find
in
Box
of
Fire

of
Aerosmith
s
career
Personally
I
love
it

These
were

still

new
albums
with
Geffen
The
first
is
a
collection
of

consists

Aerosmith

DISC
12
Gems
another
album
that
Columbia
released
while
Aerosmith
was
already
with
Geffen
to
cash
in
on
the
band
s
return
of
popularity
which
again
was
due
to
the
hits
they
were
releasing
from
Geffen
albums
like
Permanent
Vacation
and
Pump
It
was
released
in
1988
and
is
essentially
a
Greatest
Hits
volume
II
from
the
Columbia
years
I
remember
it
being
quite
popular
because
it
was
not
only
a
cheap
way
for
new
Aerosmith
fans
to
get
some
of
their
older
stuff
but
it
was
the
only
disc
on
which
you
could
get
the
studio
version
of
Chip
Away
at
the
Stone
a
1978
single
that
was
never
released
as
a
track
on
a
full
album
before
DISC
13
This
is
a
bonus
EP
with
five
tracks
There
s
a
1991
edit
of
Sweet
Emotion
which
Columbia
used
in
the
music
video
to
promote
the
Pandora
s
Box
box
set
yet
ANOTHER
thing
they
released
while
Aerosmith
was
having
success
with
Geffen
records
Also
here
is
the
live
orchestral
version
of
Dream
On
that
the
band
did
for
an
Mtv
special
and
also
released
on
the
Last
Action
Hero
soundtrack
The
other
tree
tracks
are
Circle
Jerk
the
ghost
track
from
Pandora
s
Box
and
two
other
songs
that
you
won
t
find
anywhere
else
Some
people
are
complaining
about
the
redundant
tracks
or
the
fact
that
you
could
use
less
discs
to
fit
the
same
music
Again
this
is
a
re
release
of
the
12
individual
classic
Aerosmith
albums
that
were
being
sold
individually
anyway
and
they
re
being
sold
all
together
here
as
a
collector
s
set
They
re
going
for
completeness
So
who
would
want
to
buy
this
entire
box
set
Especially
since
you
admittedly
have
some
redundant
tracks
here
with
Greatest
Hits
etc
If
you
re
just
a
casual
fan
then
by
all
means
stick
with
the
much
cheaper
Pandora
s
Box
box
set
which
Columbia
released
in
1991
On
the
other
hand
if
you
don
t
have
much
Aerosmith
on
CD
then
this
is
the
best
way
to
get
all
of
the
old
stuff
in
one
purchase
at
one
low
price
That
was
certainly
the
case
for
many
of
us
back
in
1994
when
a
lot
of
us
only
had
Aerosmith
on
vinyl
or
cassette
and
wanted
a
good
CD
replacement
Likewise
if
you
re
a
die
hard
fan
who
wants
a
complete
collection
including
those
rarities
then

A
Must
Buy
If
You
Don
t
Already
Own
These
Albums
May
28
2000
By
Bill
R
Moore
New
York
USA
This
review
is
from
Box
of
Fire
Audio
CD
By
far
the
most
comprehensive
Aerosmith
collection
available
Box
of
Fire
includes
all
of
the
band
s
Columbia
albums
with
the
exception
of
of
course
Nine
Lives
and
even
adds
a
5
cd
bonus
disc
The
discs
come
remastered
and
with
extensive
linear
notes
The
only
drawback
to
this
excellent
box
set
is
the
price
At
around
100
it
is
too
much
for
most
listeners
but
for
those
who
are
loaded
you
should
definately
get
this
collection
especially
if
you
don
t
already
own
these
albums
If
you
do
though
you
will
almost
certainly
want
to
pass
as
there
is
nothing
new
here
outside
the
five
songs
of
which
you
have
probably
already
heard
and
maybe
even
own
three
and
the
box
itself

Good
and
hopefully
getting
better
September
21
2008
By
J
Stainbrook
Chicago
This
review
is
from
Chicago
Tribune
Kindle
Edition
I
have
been
a
Chicago
Tribune
print
subscriber
for
10
years
I
wanted
to
get
the
Tribune
on
the
Kindle
for
a
number
of
reasons
no
paper
to
deal
with
ease
of
delivery
etc
While
I
m
very
glad
the
Tribune
is
now
available
on
the
Kindle
there
is
certainly
room
for
improvement
The
Kindle
version
of
the
Tribune
is
simply
a
dump
of
the
Tribune
articles
For
the
most
part
this
is
fine
the
reader
gets
all
of
the
content
minus
graphs
charts
comics
crossword
puzzle
of
the
print
edition
However
there
are
a
number
of
flaws
that
haven
t
been
corrected
yet
including
Most
columns
do
not
have
a
byline
even
after
being
told
this
would
be
corrected
it
isn
t
100
Accompanying
articles
are
out
of
order
General
formatting
e
g
lists
Occasionally
items
are
clearly
missing
e
g
Here
are
5
items
and
then
the
5
items
are
missing
US
World
blurbs
do
not
identify
the
state
or
country
It
s
clear
the
formatting
of
the
Kindle
edition
of
the
Tribune
needs
some
work
the
Tribune
needs
to
understand
how
the
reader
views
the
articles
and
format
them
accordingly
A
simple
dump

This
review
is
from
Chicago
Tribune
Kindle
Edition
Well
the
Tribune
finally
has
photos
They
re
kind
of
nice
to
have
even
if
they
make
the
file
5
10
times
bigger
a
hassle
if
you
re
in
a
war
zone
with
crappy
internet
access
The
thing
is
since
they
now
include
graphics
for
the
news
stories
there
really
isn
t
any
reason
not
to
include
comics
as
well
I
can
get
the
Tribune
online
for
the
same
price
with
the
comics
included
but
the
file
is
5
10
times
even
larger
than
it
is
now
Again
only
a
problem
where
I
m
at
but
even
when
I
m
home
I
don
t
carry
a
laptop
with
me
everywhere
as
I
can
and
do
with
the
Kindle
For
those
who
are
wondering
why
I
m
going
on
about
the
comics
look
the
paper
edition
home
delivery
is
the
same
price
approximately
as
the
online
and
Kindle
editions
If
you
re
not
going
to
include
certain
features
on
the
Kindle
edition
you
should
make
the
price
much
cheaper
I
don
t
read
the
paper
just
for
the
comics
but
if
I
m
going
to
pay
for
them
I
d
certainly
like
to
have
them
available
And
now
there
is
no
reason
not
to
include
them

This
review
is
from
Chicago
Tribune
Kindle
Edition
What
you
get
Tons
of
articles
No
pictures
comics
or
puzzles
But
then
again
are
you
really
reading
the
paper
for
a
pictures
and
puzzles
Seriously
I
m
happy
to
have
all
of
my
content
weather
included
I
m
up
to
date
on
the
news
right
on
time
I
m
usually
up
and
ready
to
read
the
paper
by
6
30a
I
m
not
sure
how
early
anyone
who
has
not
gotten
their
paper
on
time
gets
up
I
m
from
Chicago
I
like
that
how
the
Trib
has
a
nice
balance
of
local
news
and
national
news
The
stories
are
well
written
most
of
the
time
I
d
like
to
say
it
s
pretty
open
minded
for
a
newspaper
I
don
t
really
agree
with
everything
and
sometimes
I
want
more
info
But
that
s
news
right
It
s
a
fresh
opinion
before
all
the
facts
are
out
I
also
noticed
that
a
lot
of
the
bad
reviews
are
kind
of
dated
Perhaps
they
ve
perfected
their
system
That
s
a
good
sign

What
s
this
This
review
is
from
iview
1300LEDTV
13
3
Inch
720p
LCD
TV
DVD
Combo
Black
Electronics
Bought
this
set
sight
unseen
to
sit
on
our
kitchen
table
because
the
screen
size
seemed
ideal
and
it
is
The
picture
s
fine
as
you
would
expect
of
an
HDTV
Set
up
was
delayed
because
our
cable
end
was
not
flexible
enough
to
make
the
short
right
turn
over
the
stand
and
into
the
set
from
the
bottom
After
many
unsuccessful
attempts
to
attach
I
bought
a
five
dollar
90
degree
cable
adapter
from
Radio
Shack
and
that
made
the
connection
easy
My
cable
is
u
verse
rather
than
basic
so
I
found
the
manual
directions
for
setting
up
cable
channels
did
not
work
Instead
I
set
up
to
detect
and
store
the
regular
TV
channels
and
the
u
verse
channels
could
then
be
found
on
channel
three
and
changed
with
the
cable
zapper
My
cable
remote
could
not
come
up
with
the
code
for
the
new
set
so
I
called
the
support
number
on
the
manual
and
e
mailed
the
support
site
twice
each
leaving
messages
asking
for
the
four
digit
code
to
the
remote
Never
got
a
response
If
anyone
knows
it
please
mention
it
in
a
review
at
this
site
I
d
appreciate
it
Until
then
we
ve
got
the
channels
on
the
cable
zapper
and
the
volume
on
the
TV
remote
The
DVD
did
not
work
using
the
direction
in
the
manual
to
face
the
label
toward
the
front
of
the
set
We
found
an
arrow
on
the
side
of
the
TV
positioned
the
DVD
label
toward
the
back
of
the
set
and
it
works
I
hope
the
earlier
reviewer
whose
DVD
wasn
t
working
finds
this
and
tries
it
The
sound
of
this
TV
is
very
weak
and
thin
like
that
of
an
old
small
transistor
radio
Half
the
people
on
it
sounded
like
they
had
lisps
there
was
so
much
buzz
even
with
treble
turned
way
down
with
the
equalizer
I
added
a
cheap
pair
of
speakers
15
because
of
their
small
size
and
USB
power
and
the
improvement
was
huge
The
speakers
attach
to
the
earphone
jack
the
only
audio
out
and
the
USB
connection
at
the
bottom
of
the
set
It
took
a
lot
of
re
rigging
but
we
re
finally
pretty
happy
with
the
set

This
review

from
Venturer
KLV3915
15
4
Inch
Undercabinet
Kitchen
LCD
TV
DVD
Combo
Electronics
I
did
my
homework
on
these
units
There
are
not
many
of
these
under
counter
all
in
one
tvs
left
So
my
score
is
in
comparison
to
what
is
out
there
Pros
Big
screen
this
is
a
nice
feature
as
most
units
have
much
smaller
screens
Plays
DVDs
I
have
no
problems
with
this
feature
Has
good
reception
All
my
channels
come
in
fairly
good
Cable
TV
FM
AM
Cheapest
of
all
units
with
this
screen
size
Magnetic
remote
for
the
fridge
I
have
heard
people
complain
about
this
feature
because
it
is
not
strong
enough
to
hold
the
remote
up
I
am
guessing
that
is
because
they
have
a
stainless
steel
fridge
which
has
less
magnetic
for
the
most
part
in
comparison
to
a
standard
metal
finish
Cons
Picture
quality
is
not
so
great
I
think
this
is
because
of
the
slow
response
time
of
the
screen
I
also
noticed
that
the
picture
was
much
better
when
a
HD
signal
was
present
Selecting
presets
is
difficult
This
is
by
far
the
biggest
issue
for
me
It
is
not
easy
to
select
your
favorite
channels
I
have
also
noticed
that
selecting
presets
is
done
differently
between
the
tv
and
the
radio
When
the
timer
is
on
I
have
not
figured
out
a
way
to
see
it
count
down
So
until
it
goes
off
you
have
no
idea
how
much
time
is
left
Remote
does
not
make
it
across
the
room
I
tested
it
and
it
goes
about
10
feet
In
reality
how
much
farther
will
you
view
a
15
inch
screen
from
You
really
need
the
remote
to
use
this
unit
I
am
sure
there
is
a
way
to
use
the
buttons
on
the
unit
but
the
remote
is
much
easier
I
Wish
they
would
have
done
preselects
on
the
unit
Summary
Not
a
bad
unit
but
if
picture
is
important
to
you
then
this
is
not
the
unit
for
you
I
am
not
sure
the
other
units
are
any
better
in
fact
most
of
these
units
look
to
come
from
the
same
design
I
assume
they
have
updated
the
screen
for
vendors
like
RCA
but
not
sure
IF
you
are
looking
for
a
simple
inexpensive
unit
that
has
a
big
screen
then
it
is
not
a
bad
option
I
have
had
the
unit
for
2
months
and
no
problems
yet
We
watch
the
news
every
day
while
making
dinner

Nice
big

No
problems
so
far
and
have
been
using
it
about
6
weeks
I
shopped
and
this
was
the
best
choice
I
could
find
for
a
TV
DVD
CD
combo
Sound
is
loud
enough
although
it
could
be
a
little
higher
fidelity
when
using
as
a
CD
player
It
s
a
trade
off
worth
making
to
be
able
to
save
the
space
and
have
a
screen
you
can
actually
see
from
more
than
a
foot
away
I
recommend
it

this
replaced
a
slightly
larger
screen
my
sons
insisted
on
twisting
everytime
the
went
to
the
kitchen
table
every
2
or
3
days
I
d
have
to
push
it
back
to
protect
it
from
falling
onto
the
floor
The
Venturer
screen
is
the
largest
I
ve
seen
The
270
degree
swivel
means
it
can
go
to
either
side
even
though
it
turned
opposite
the
way
we
usually
watch
it
getting
it
face
on
to
the
table
left
of
the
screen
as
we
look
at
it
from
the
front
is
no
problem
Picture
quality
and
sound
are
great
DVD
is
built
in
works
without
problem
I
have
only
2
even
minor
issues
1st
CAUTION
when
installing
our
cabinet
was
shallow
enough
there
was
nearly
not
enough
room
to
fix
it
in
place
I
had
to
drill
a
2nd
set
of
holes
1
2
forward
of
where
the
paper
template
said
holes
should
be
drilled
so
PUT
THE
UNIT
UP
BEFORE
YOU
DRILL
TO
MAKE
SURE
IT
FITS
2nd
the
remote
IR
sensor
is
at
the
front
of
the
unit
including
when
the
screen
is
turned
left
or
right
We
have
at
times
found
it
impossible
to
change
the
station
or
volume
from
where
we
were
sitting
a
mirror
on
the
fridge
has
helped
in
our
case
All
in
all
it
was
a
great
investment
saves
us
counter
space
is
better
protected
than
the
set
it
replaced
went
up
without
a
real
hitch
of
significance

This
review
is
from
Make
The
Most
Of
Your
Time
On
Earth
1000
Ultimate
Travel
Experiences
Rough
Guides
Paperback
I
just
love
this
cover
that
little
red
and
yellow
micro
bus
just
calls
out
Get
in
and
let
s
go
find
an
adventure
When
younger
more
adventurous
or
those
seeking
a
different
agenda
for
their
trip
come
into
the
library
looking
for
travel
books
I
try
to
put
a
Rough
Guide
in
their
hands
Why
From
editor
James
Smart
When
we
started
writing
Rough
Guides
we
wanted
to
share
the
kind
of
travel
we
had
been
doing
ourselves
We
wanted
to
push
travel
a
bit
further
inspiring
our
readers
to
get
away
from
the
established
routes
even
if
that
meant
getting
lost
occasionally
and
seek
something
that
little
bit
more
special
and
authentic
in
short
to
settle
for
nothing
less
than
an
ultimate
travel
experience
Well
Make
the
Most
of
Your
Time
on
Earth
has
detailed
1000
of
those
unique
travel
experiences
Thirty
years
of
Rough
Guide
writers
personal
recommendations
are
included
with
200
new
additions
in
this
2nd
edition
And
indeed
the
world
is
covered
I
ve
been
reading
this
book
off
and
on
for
a
couple
of
months
now
The
fold
out
front
cover
has
a
colour
coded
legend
to
the
geographical
areas
The
bottom
right
corner
of
the
pages
have
that
same
colour
block
allowing
you
to
flip
quickly
to
a
certain
section
A
map
begins
every
section
I
must
admit
I
read
in
no
particular
order
I
just
jumped
to
whatever
grabbed
my
interest
Full
colour
photographs
punctuate
the
descriptions
The
writing
style
is
informal
and
breezy
reflecting
the
overall
tone
of
the
book
Each
chapter
ends
with
a
Need
to
Know
page
that
includes
phone
numbers
and
web
addresses
for
the
attractions
listed
A
Good
to
Know
page
includes
general
facts
about
that
particular
region
as
well
as
interesting
notes
about
etiquette
quotes
and
odd
facts
There
s
only
one
country
in
the
world
with
a
three
dollar
bill
answer
at
the
end
of
the
post
The
focus
of
each
experience
can
vary
greatly
Sometimes
it
s
the
scenery
the
culture
wildlife
nightlife
festivals
sport
food
adventures
and
the
unusual
Booklovers
might
want
to
visit
Hay
on
Wye
in
Wales
where
the
ratio
of
bookstores
to
humans
is
40
1
It
s
been
estimated
that
there
are
over
a
million
books
in
this
tiny
town
I
discovered
countries
I
had
not
heard
of
before
The
smallest
nation
in
Africa
is
Sao
Tome
and
Principe
home
to
some
of
the
best
chocolate
coca
beans
the
world
produces
I
was
thrilled
to
see
that
I
had
done
many
of
the
things
listed
in
the
Canadian
section
I
ve
skated
on
the
Rideau
Canal
been
to
the
Calgary
Stampede
cruised
Georgian
Bay
seen
Niagara
Falls
many
times
and
a
few
more
I
m
hoping
to
travel
to
the
East
Coast
this
year
and
there
were
lots
of
suggestions
for
that
side
of
the
country
There
was
just
so
much
to
see
and
read
about
Our
world
truly
is
amazing
Make
the
Most
of
Your
Time
on
Earth
does
a
fantastic
job
of
showcasing
1000
things
to
see
and
do
Great
reading
for
the
avid
traveller
armchair
or
otherwise
That
three
dollar
bill
Found
only
in
Roratonga

Guides
Paperback
I
love
this
book
I
got
it
as
a
present
and
think
it
is
a
great
starting
point
for
my
future
adventures
There
is
a
lot
of
information
here
and
it
is
broken
up
both
by
region
of
the
world
and
by
the
activity
in
that
region
Keep
in
mind
that
this
book
doesn
t
specifically
say
go
to
Belize
and
do
this
through
this
company
and
here
s
their
website
Instead
it
is
the
authors
talking
about
the
most
amazing
experiences
they
have
had
and
you
are
going
to
have
to
do
the
leg
work
of
researching
the
destination
plane
tickets
travel
companies
etc
This
isn
t
an
all
inclusive
guide
that
tells
you
exactly
what
to
do
it
is
more
of
a
jumping
off
point
to
see
which
adventures
pique
your
interest
and
going
from
there

What
s
this
This
review
is
from
Paintball
Xtreme
Rage
Xray
Single
Lens
Anti
Fog
Mask
Misc
I
recently
bought
this
paintball
mask
and
i
read
a
lot
of
reviews
on
it
before
i
bought
it
some
people
said
it
fogged
and
some
said
it
didn
t
some
don
t
like
to
look
of
the
mask
or
other
petty
personal
opinion
dislikes
I
am
writing
this
review
on
the
performance
of
the
mask
only
not
the
looks
I
live
in
St
Louis
and
it
is
a
very
muggy
humid
city
the
first
day
I
used
this
mask
it
was
over
90
degrees
and
very
humid
and
I
was
playing
woodsball
and
doing
a
lot
of
running
and
sliding
and
dodging
So
first
I
would
like
to
say
that
this
mask
DID
NOT
FOG
AT
ALL
I
am
28
years
old
and
i
wear
glasses
and
this
mask
was
comfortable
and
felt
nice
I
almost
didn
t
even
know
I
was
wearing
it
I
had
no
problems
with
any
features
of
this
mask
AT
ALL
Bottom
line
this
is
an
all
around
GREAT
mask
and
I
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
that
is
looking
for
a
great
mask
that
fits
good
fits
very
good
over
glasses
if
you
trim
the
foam
it
fits
better
then
if
you
don
t
looks
good
does
not
fog
and
doesn
t
cost
an
arm
and
a
leg
so
in
short
BUY
THIS
MASK
Its
AWESOME

What
s
this
I
used
to
rent
the
goggles
at
the
fields
but
WOW
buying
your
own
pair
is
DEFINITELY
worth
the
money
when
you
have
people
shooting
at
you
and
you
can
SEE
them
priceless
These
goggles
have
a
large
viewable
range
on
the
lens
and
it
doesn
t
fog
up
very
easy
at
all
It
is
comfortable
and
has
proven
its
durability
For
a
beginner
these
are
perfect

What
s
this
This
review
is
from
Tippmann
Low
Profile
Bulk
Cyclone
Hopper
Sports
The
standard
tippmann
A
5
is
big
and
bulky
and
is
hard
to
see
around
when
shooting
and
usually
the
biggest
thing
that
gets
shot
at
other
than
your
head
The
low
profile
hopper
is
great
because
it
eliminates
both
of
those
problems
it
s
rectangular
in
shape
and
sits
way
lower
to
the
gun
unblocking
your
iron
sights
it
also
holds
the
same
amount
as
the
stock
hopper
maybe
even
a
couple
more
this
hopper
is
great
if
your
looking
to
be
more
efficient
on
the
battle
feild
and
if
you
want
your
gun
to
look
good

This

from
Tippmann
Low
Profile
Bulk
Cyclone
Hopper
Sports
This
came
with
my
A5
In
comparison
to
a
standard
gravity
hopper
this
thing
is
awesome
Your
marker
actually
feels
like
a
gun
without
a
bulky
plastic
thing
on
top
Very
durable
and
rugged
The
mouth
is
wide
and
the
lid
stays
on
securely
The
low
profile
greatly
reduces
exposure
during
play
I
love
it

Hopper
Sports
Im
going
all
milsim
so
when
I
saw
this
bad
boy
i
couldnt
resist
I
got
the
tippman
cyclone
feeder
so
i
could
use
this
i
didnt
kno
the
cyclone
feeder
came
with
a
hopper
from
tippman
but
comparing
this
hopper
to
the
tippman
one
this
one
looks
alot
more
sexy
Only
reason
i
didnt
give
it
5
stars
is
because
the
lid
doesnt
snap
open
just
kind
of
floats
open
but
its
no
big
deal
I
dont
think
this
is
an
actual
Tippman
hopper
but
still
its
really
a
good
deal

This
review
is
from
TwiLITE
A
Parody
Kindle
Edition
We
have
both
Twilight
lovers
and
haters
in
the
family
All
thought
this
was
laugh
out
loud
funny
or
ROFL
if
you
are
my
daughter
The
dry
humor
totally
nailed
everything
in
Twilight
that
deserved
to
be
poked
fun
at
Never
thought
there
d
be
any
piece
of
literature
that
would
make
both
my
wife
and
daughter
laugh
over
a
book
they
had
totally
opposite
opinions
about
so
I
read
it
too
Even
I
could
not
put
it
down
and
I
d
only
seen
the
movie
not
voluntarily

What
s
this
This
review
is
from
TwiLITE
A
Parody
Paperback
In
my
view
this
doesn
t
even
qualify
as
a
parody
What
it
is
is
a
blow
by
blow
summary
of
Twilight
in
which
the
author
doesn
t
bother
trying
to
mimic
Stephenie
Meyer
s
style
but
merely
removes
almost
all
dialogue
and
descriptions
of
Edward
s
unearthly
beauty
admittedly
comprising
most
of
the
original
work
to
make
room
for
many
repetitive
snarky
remarks
on
character
behavior
and
commentary
that
makes
Bella
more
overtly
self
centered
I
will
admit
that
some
of
these
remarks
were
right
on
but
the
fourth
or
fifth
time
I
read
a
sentence
like
He
watches
me
sleep
Cool
right
and
there
are
a
lot
of
them
I
d
pretty
much
had
it
There
are
no
new
character
directions
in
the
story
no
attempts
to
add
any
unique
details
Two
stars
because
it
only
takes
about
1
10
as
long
to
get
through
this
as
it
takes
for
Twilight

waves
to
the
crowd
with
his
family
in
tow
a
patriotic
song
swells
in
the
background
As
Mitt
s
photographic
moment
played
out
the
song
playing
was
K
naan
s
Waving
Flag
It
turns
out
that
Romney
s
camp
did
not
get
approval
from
the
rapper
to
turn
the
2009
anthem
into
his
campaign
theme
song
The
Somalian
Canadian
MC
turned
to
twitter
to
let
his
thoughts
be
heard
Yo
mittromney
I
am
K
naan
Warsame
and
I
do
not
endorse
this
message
the
rapper
tweeted
In
a
statement
released
today
K
naan
elaborated
that
he
was
offended
by
the
use
of
the
song
and
does
not
endorse
the
candidate
in
any
way
Warsame
and
his
legal
team
are
currently
exploring
their
options
in
order
to
prevent
Romney
from
further
using
the
song
during
his
campaign
to
become
the
Republican
candidate
for
president
If
I
had
been
asked
I
would
certainly
not
have
granted
it
The
Troubadour
explained
I
would
happily
grant
the
Obama
campaign
use
of
my
song
without
prejudice
K
naan
released
his
More
Beautiful
Than
Silence
EP
last
week

Trina
Hernandez
Shaking
Things
Up
In
Austin
February
8
2012
by
Rebecca
Price
When
I
first
joined
twitter
Trina
was
one
of
the
people
who
stood
out
She
is
funny
clever
and
always
on
the
forefront
of
Austin
happenings
She
s
also
empathetic
warm
and
a
passionate
advocate
for
health
and
the
Hispanic
community
Here
she
is
in
her
own
words
I
am
a
blogger
copywriter
and
Social
Media
maven
clawing
her
way
towards
making
her
passion
a
career
I
m
also
widely
known
as
an
early
adopter
of
new
Social
platforms
How
many
online
accounts
do
you
have
is
a
frequent
question
I
get
an
internet
enthusiast
fanatic
of
food
trucks
wearer
of
chanclas
geeky
over
technology
I
share
it
all
over
the
web
as
well
as
on
my
blog
Tacos
y
Gatos
How
You
Can
Find
Trina
My
Website
My
Facebook
My
Twitter
Which
Social
sites
do
you
visit
every
single
day
Most
definitely
Twitter
Facebook
Tumblr
Instagram
Flickr
and
Foursquare
Everything
else
just
depends
on
what
kind
of
day
it
is
I
happen
to
know
you
as
a
particularly
early
adopter
in
the
tech
world
You
seem
to
always
be
just
ahead
of
the
newest
trends
What
are
you
particularly
proud
to
have
been
early
on
Is
there
anything
you
adopted
too
late
I
m
particularly
proud
of
being
an
early
adopter
of
Flickr
My
friend
sent
me
an
invite
and
since
2004
I
ve
been
a
fan
To
say
it
fueled
my
love
and
inspiration
in
photography
at
the
young
age
of
22
would
be
an
accurate
statement
I
would
say
I
was
late
joining
the
Facebook
crowd
I
didn
t
open
that
account
until
a
year
and
a
half
ago
I
just
didn
t
understand
why
people
would
talk
to
their
friends
there
rather
than
text
call
or
see
them
Once
I
realized
that
I
was
able
to
keep
in
contact
with
my
family
in
Mexico
I
m
lucky
if
I
see
them
at
least
once
a
year
I
was
pretty
much
on
board
What
are
your
predictions
about
Google
and
Chime
in
Do
you
think
they
ll
stick
around
or
prove
to
be
just
passing
trends
How
often
do
you
get
on
both
I
see
the
potential
each
platform
carries
I
would
say
that
if
you
haven
t
experienced
Twitter
or
Facebook
previously
one
could
very
easily
prefer
these
over
the
others
But
once
you
have
a
taste
preference
for
a
service
it
s
hard
to
leave
that
shell
and
move
into
something
new
I
m
a
curious
being
and
I
love
finding
new
services
that
may
just
convince
me
otherwise
Unfortunately
Chime
in
didn
t
do
anything
for
me
that
I
wasn
t
already
getting
from
twitter
so
I
hardly
if
ever
visit
the
site
unless
someone
mentions
me
As
for
Google
I
try
to
log
on
every
day
and
scope
the
scene
I
m
starting
to
see
the
growth
and
have
high
hopes
for
it
My
family
is
starting
to
join
the
G
bandwagon
so
we
ll
see
where
it
goes
What
is
your
favorite
thing
about
Social
Media
More
than
anything
the
people
you
meet
and
connections
you
make
I
have
friends
in
Malaysia
Singapore
India
Canada
and
of
course
Mexico
I
love
learning
about
their
cultures
their
surroundings
and
teaching
them
my
own
I
also
love
meeting
the
locals
I
love
how
you
can
basically
go
as
far
deep
as
the
person
lets
you
into
their
lives
I
love
the
ability
to
share
my
own
life
because
I
m
pretty
much
an
open
book
I
love
using
it
as
a
tool
to
express
myself
to
learn
from
others
and
hopefully
be
informational
and
funny
along
the
way
Overall
I
just
love
how
easy
it
is
to
be
in
one
s
life
especially
when
you
re
so
far
apart
Dare
I
mention
I
met
my
husband
of
six
years
via
Social
Media
Thanks
MySpace
Tell
me
about
your
blog
Tacosygatos
is
a
WordPress
site
where
I
blog
about
food
Austin
family
being
Latina
photography
Social
Media
technology
etc
The
sky
is
the
definitely
not
the
limit
I
don
t
like
encasing
myself
in
just
one
category
Let
s
talk
about
Klout
which
measures
Social
influence
among
users
Do
you
love
it
Follow
it
I
forgot
to
add
my
Klout
Page
I
think
right
now
the
only
thing
bugging
me
is
the
whole
Klout
thing
I
love
Klout
but
then
sometimes
I
dislike
it
The
only
time
I
truly
dislike
it
is
when
my
score
goes
down
As
to
whether
it
s
truly
accurate
in
being
a
tool
to
measure
one
s
influence
I
m
on
the
fence
It
s
become
my
own
personal
battle
very
much
like
a
Catholic
trying
to
decide
if
there
is
a
God
or
not
Weird
but
true
I
highly
believe
Klout
will
improve
in
more
ways
than
one
when
it
comes
to
measuring
one
s
influence
With
the
recent
change
when
some
people
s
scores
either
went
drastically
down
or
up
I
was
convinced
that
they
are
still
learning
and
with
that
learning
comes
more
improvement
But
with
that
improvement
comes
more
proof
that
I
may
not
be
as
influential
as
I
thought
I
d
be
BUT
At
the
same
time
I
feel
like
I
have
something
to
work
towards
It
s
like
some
sort
of
weird
goal
Congratulations
on
your
Statesman
Social
Media
Award
Nomination
Thanks
to
my
dear
friend
UndercoverMexi
I
ve
been
nominated
for
a
Statesman
Social
Media
Award
If
you
could
take
a
minute
or
five
to
vote
for
Tacos
y
Gatos
I
will
be
forever
thankful
and
most
appreciative
Good
luck
to
all
the
nominees
Vote
HERE
Lately
you
ve
been
blogging
about
your
journey
towards
health
and
fitness
I
ve
personally
been
inspired
by
your
efforts
and
steady
success
I
feel
really
strongly
about
promoting
health
in
Austin
and
in
the
Hispanic
community
The
natural
place
to
start
is
with
me
Two
places
I
blog
about
healthy
living
are
Tacos
y
Gatos
and
FitVision
I
m
super
stoked
with
myself
Three
weeks
ago
I
was
barely
able
to
do
20
minutes
at
a
resistance
level
of
10
on
the
elliptical
Just
this
morning
I
did
a
whole
hour
4
miles
It
s
amazing
what
our
bodies
can
do
if
we
just
push
em
Google
s
recent
change
in
the
way
they
do
search
has
caused
ripples
in
the
Social
Media
world
What
are
your
thoughts
Don
t
get
me
started
on
Google
Actually
I
m
starting
to
appreciate
the
new
search
It
s
interesting
to
see
what
my
friends
and
acquaintances
have
to
say
about
certain
things
I
Google
In
all
honesty
I
don
t
think
it
s
changed
much
Google
is
like
many
other
tech
companies
evolving
It
s
seeking
to
accommodate
the
needs
of
others
Some
will
like
it
some
won
t
Those
that
don
t
will
later
come
to
appreciate
it
Everyone
threw
a
fit
about
Facebook
s
Timeline
Now
who
s
complaining
It
s
a
free
service
Changes
will
happen
If
anything
we
all
benefit
from
changes
We
learn
to
adapt
We
learn
to
grow
along
with
these
companies
It
s
a
little
thing
known
the
Tech
Life

burner
and
stainless

components
on
a

With
Broil
King
a

grill

just
as

and
durable
as
a
large
one
Our
barbecues
are
built
by
people
who
love
to
grill
For
decades
we
have
been
building
grills
for
barbecue
enthusiasts
all
over
the
world
The
heart
of
the
grill
is
the
oven
itself
While
an
inferior
cook
box
is
less
expensive
to
manufacture
Broil
King
s
cast
aluminum
oven
is
superior
in
every
way
Aluminum
is
rust
proof
retains
heat
for
even
and
efficient
cooking
and
because
it
is
die
cast
not
stamped
we
are
able
to
mold
it
into
a
shape
that
will
improve
cooking
performance

The
Cover
Store
carries
a
complete
assortment
of
patio
table
covers
and
patio
table
and
chair
set
covers
This
72
diameter
round
table
cover
is
designed
to
be
used
on
an
outdoor
table
without
chairsand
does
not
havea
hole
foran
umbrella
If
you
needother
patio
table
covers
that
have
a
hole
in
the
middle
please
see
our
Patio
Table
Cover
overview
page
or
navigate
to
our
other
sizes
and
styles
by
using
the
selection
tool
above
We
also
have
table
only
covers
that
are
oval
and
rectangular
in
shape
so
you
should
be
able
to
find
a
patio
table
cover
that
fits
your
outdoor
table
This
outside
table
cover
is
round
but
it
will
cover
both
square
and
round
tables
It
should
cover
round
tables
up
to
72
in
diameter
and
square
tables
up
to
50
x
50
If
you
need
a
smaller
round
patio
table
cover
see
our
54
bistro
table
cover
It
is
made
of
durable
yet
lightweight
300
denier
polyester
so
it
is
easy
to
put
on
and
take
off
There
are
no
straps
or
ties
that
need
to
be
fastened
Instead
our
outside
table
covers
use
an
elastic
bottom
with
a
built
in
draw
cord
to
keep
the
cover
snug
and
secure
Built
in
mesh
vents
provide
for
needed
air
circulation
around
the
cover
to
help
stop
mold
and
mildew
from
taking
place
As
with
all
of
our
patio
furniture
covers
from
our
Elite
collection
this
round
patio
table
cover
is
constructed
using
double
stitching
on
all
the
seams
We
even
pay
attention
to
the
details
on
the
underside
of
the
patio
table
cover
by
surge
stitching
all
the
raw
edges
of
the
fabric
to
make
sure
that
there
will
be
no
loose
threads
or
unraveling
over
time

Add
comfort
and
style
with
our
specially
designed
cushions
All
of
our
cushions
are
made
of
Sunbrella
fabric
Developed
from
30
years
experience
with
awnings
and
boat
Sunbrella
is
made
of
durable
all
weather
solution
dyed
acrylic
Each
cushion
has
ample
length
ties
to
keep
your
cushion
in
place
even
during
those
gusty
days
Single
piping
provides
a
clean
looking
finished
edge
These
cushions
are
filled
with
3
inches
of
foam
and
polyester
that
makes
our
already
comfortable
benches
and
chairs
even
more
so
Sunbrella
feels
soft
and
comfortable
to
the
touch
but
is
rugged
outdoors
It
retains
its
color
and
strength
while
withstanding
years
of
exposure
to
sunlight
and
rain

The
Arc
Hammock
Stand
is
the
product
to
enjoy
for
years
as
an
incredible
addition
of
relaxation
to
any
backyard
or
around
pool
deck
The
hammock
bed
is
constructed
of
a
greatly
durable
FSC
High
Density
Eucalyptus
Shorea
High
Density
Eucalyptus
or
also
known
as
Shorea
in
our
line
is
the
premium
grade
of
solid
Eucalyptus
Gradis
hardwood
grown
in
100
percent
well
managed
forests
in
Brazil
certified
by
the
FSC
Forest
Stewardship
Council
There
is
little
difference
between
High
Density
Eucalyptus
Shorea
and
Teak
when
broken
down
to
their
core
essence
The
biggest
attribute
of
High
Density
Eucalyptus
Shorea
is
undoubtedly
the
strength
of
the
timber
It
s
renowned
for
its
excellent
resistance
to
every
day
wear
and
tear
It
is
extremely
durable
and
tightly
grained
to
produce
a
desirable
density
It
remains
unaffected
by
all
variations
in
weather
especially
its
resistance
to
damp
conditions
makes
itself
extremely
competent
at
combating
insect
attacks
and
decay

the
comfortable
design
of
an
Adirondack
chair
to
your
patio
swing
This
wood
swing
is

of
snagging
If
left
unstained
unsealed
the
cedar
will
weather
to
a
silver

patina
look
and
will
maintain
a
very
smooth
texture
Zinc

ensures
this

What
s
this
This
worked
well
with
my
husbands
70
s
costume
The
only
complaint
was
that
the
string
was
way
to
long
on
the
necklace
and
we
had
to
put
a
knot
in
it
to
make
it
hang
right

Wig
didn
t
look
anything
like
photo
It
was
very
short
and
frizzy
It
was
money
lost
because
you
can
t
return
wigs
I
feel
the
company
should
be
held
accountable
for
misrepresentation
Oh
well
lesson

I
will
not

anymore

from

This
review
is
from
Vintage
T
Shirts
MORE
THAN
500
AUTHENTIC
TEES
FROM
THE
70S
AND
80S
Paperback
I
bought
this
book
sight
unseen
off
Amazon
and
was
immediately
disappointed
as
soon
as
I
opened
the
cover
I
was
hoping
for
a
collection
of
cool
designs
that
would
inspire
me
for
my
graphic
design
work
Maybe
one
third
of
the
designs
are
quality
at
best
the
rest
are
very
mediocre
One
page
has
six
variations
of
the
same
Mickey
Mouse
T
shirt
with
different
text
WTF
There
is
a
T
shirt
with
the
original
M
TV
logo
one
with
a
Pepsi
logo
you
get
the
idea
The
book
is
more
of
a
historical
catalog
than
anything
else
The
book
also
has
several
interviews
with
losers
who
collect
T
s
and
have
hundreds
of
them
and
who
provided
the
shirts
featured
in
the
book
Who
cares
not
me

I
bought
this
book
as
a
form
of
research
since
I
currently
work
at
a
screen
printing
shop
in
town
and
it
did
not
disappoint
Getting
to
see
these
old
shirts
separated
by
genre
was
a
great
way
to
get
some
new
ideas
for
designs

Hi
Everyone
I
hope
you
all
are
doing
well
Today
s
outfit
is
a
casual
classic
with
a
twist
The
color
scheme
is
red
white
and
blue
but
I
mixed
texture
and
pattern
to
create
a
fresh
look
My
vintage
men
s
blazer
is
from
a
thrift
store
I
m
guessing
it
s
from
the
70s
The
striped
shirt
is
from
Lane
Bryant
The
straight
leg
jeans
are
from
Lane
Bryant
The
red
wedges
are
from
Marks
Spencers
I
hope
you
enjoyed
my
outfit
of
the
day
Thanks
for
watching

sent
everyone
out
in
droves
to
the
local
Goodwills
Trolling
through
mounds
of

grandmothers
clothes
in
hopes
to
find

What
s
this
This
worked
well
with
my
husbands
70
s
costume
The
only
complaint
was
that
the
string
was
way
to
long
on
the
necklace
and
we
had
to
put
a
knot
in
it
to
make
it
hang
right

Wig
didn

look
anything

It

It
was

I
feel
the

This
item
is
not
just
for
Halloween
This
cute
little
number
is
my
go
to
wig
for
any
time
I
want
to
be
gay
for
a
night
I
got
the
disco
shades
and
smooth
fake
mustache
too
The
whole
ensemble
is
highly
recommended
It
makes
me
feel
so
liberated
And
the
best
part
is
I
can
take
it
off
in
the
morning
and
it
s
like
nothing
ever
happened
Nothing
you
hear
me

I
don
t
know
how
this
wig
did
it
but
it
s
synthetic
hair
has
miraculous
powers
All
my
life
I
ve
wanted
nothing
more
than
to
be
Gay
But
sadly
I
was
born
straight
Why
was
life
so
cruel
I
often
wondered
as
I
cried
myself
to
sleep
Then
I
saw
this
gay
wig
and
thought
why
not
I
put
on
this
wig
and
suddenly
all
I
can
think
is
gay
gay
gay
I
m
wearing
rainbow
flags
and
I
ve
learned
all
the
words
to
Cabaret
in
a
week
Now
my
dream
has
finally
come
true
Thank
you
You
saved
my
life

Had
to
dress
up
as
Geraldo
Rivera
and
this
wig
worked
pretty
well
Just
your
basic
wig
nothing
fancy
but
the
hair
seems
to
be
staying
in
and
it
looks
ok

Worth

April

By
A
Customer
This
review
is
from
Lonely
Planet
Bermuda
Bermuda
a
Travel
Survival
Kit
Paperback
I
spent
two
weeks
in
Bermuda
and
was
very
glad
I
brought
this
book
along
with
me
I
doubt
very
much
that
there
are
many
interesting
corners
of
the
country
that
have
been
overlooked
by
the
authors
of
this
guide
some
of
which
I
never
would
have
thought
to
investigate
had
this
book
not
alerted
me
to
their
existence
I
especially
appreciated
all
the
historical
and
cultural
details
and
found
that
it
was
an
invaluable
tool
in
keeping
costs
down
in
a
country
where
just
about
everything
is
VERY
pricey
This
book
has
since
been
re
used
by
other
members
of
my
family
on
their
own
trips
to
Bermuda
and
has
paid
for
itself
several
times
over

A
great
achievement
for
a
small
place
September
22
2002
By
Maurizio
Giuliano
Sarajevo
Bosnia
Herzegovina
This
review
is
from
Lonely
Planet
Bermuda
Paperback
The
major
obstacle
which
hinders
the
performance
of
Lonely
Planet
and
other
guidebooks
is
that
they
often
try
and
cover
a
very
wide
country
or
region
such
as
Lonely
Planet
China
or
Lonely
Planet
USA
not
to
mention
things
like
Lonely
Planet
Africa
on
a
shoestring
This
often
means
that
in
over
800
pages
of
a
bulky
book
only
few
are
really
relevant
to
what
the
reader
is
looking
for
Indeed
the
reader
can
be
lost
among
lots
of
information
data
etc
which
she
or
he
has
no
interest
in
if
I
find
myself
in
Nairobi
and
am
looking
for
a
restaurant
do
I
really
need
to
find
myself
browsing
information
about
the
visa
procedures
for
Cameroon
or
the
hotels
of
Sierra
Leone
Luckily
Bermuda
is
a
much
smaller
place
and
this
has
enabled
the
author
and
editors
to
truly
produce
a
well
focused
condensed
and
overall
excellent
guidebook
The
information
for
the
visitor
is
complete
and
accurate
up
to
date
and
indeed
extremely
useful
even
in
a
place
which
does
not
present
particular
cultural
or
social
obstacles
for
the
average
visitor
while
Bermuda
may
still
be
possible
to
get
to
know
on
one
s
own
the
aid
of
this
little
guidebook
will
be
paramount
Its
sections
on
hotels
restaurants
entertainment
are
excellent
Coverage
of
things
to
see
and
do
sports
and
other
activities
is
down
to
the
point
and
very
full
The
sections
on
history
and
culture
are
also
of
great
value
excellently
written
easy
to
read
in
a
captivating
and
pleasant
prose
making
this
truly
enjoyable
and
worthy
reading
for
everyone
It
is
indeed
a
book
one
should
surely
pack
before
setting
off
to
Bermuda

so
Coupled
with
Insight
s
laminated
eraseable
map
it
was
all
I
needed
for
my
9
day
trip
The
Guide
is
set
up
by
Bermuda
s
parishes
which
is
a
bit
cumbersome
until
you
get
a
grasp
of
the
island
s
geography
Even
when
you
do
it
s
a
bit
difficult
to
figure
out
if
the
place
you
saw
on
the
road
by
bus
is
in
Warwick
or
Southampton
or
Somerset
Parish
So
the
really
map
helped
orient
me
before
I
hit
the
tarmac
As
my
work
keeps
me
indoors
when
at
home
I
like
to
spend
as
much
time
as
possible
physically
engaged
in
the
outdoors
when
I
m
on
vacation
The
only
portion
of
the
guide
which
should
be
changed
is
the
part
about
biking
the
Old
Railway
Trail
This
trail
ranges
from
grass
with
a
tire
rut
to
dirt
and
rocks
through
the
woods
to
becoming
synonymous
with
the
main
roads
of
the
island
depending
on
whether
it
s
been
taken
over
by
development
Very
little
of
the
trail
is
paved
off
of
the
main
road
and
there
are
places
with
steep
grades
with
steps
Also
about
every
quarter
to
half
mile
on
the
real
trail
there
are
metal
barriers
over
which
you
have
to
lift
your
bike
making
a
continuous
pedal
cumbersome
The
scenery
is
great
on
many
portions
of
Warwick
and
Somerset
in
particular
but
I
wouldn
t
plan
on
a
cycling
vacation
for
exercise
or
for
primary
transportation
Cycling
the
roads
is
precarious
as
they
are
barely
wide
enough
for
two
cars
and
I
never
saw
a
straight
segment
of
street
on
the
island
Shrubbery
juts
out
from
stone
walls
at
bike
level
in
yards
all
over
the
island
making
the
situation
even
more
difficult
I
did
about
40
miles
of
trail
and
road
and
although
I
m
happy
I
did
it
I
wouldn
t
recommend
it
for
the
faint
of
heart
Scooters
look
pretty
dangerous
and
accidents
and
fatalities
are
rampant
even
amongst
locals
I
took
a
ride
my
last
evening
on
the
back
of
one
and
the
curvy
roads
are
precarious
even
when
seated
behind
an
experienced
local
I
m
a
big
risk
taker
but
I
respect
limits
of
common
sense
No
rental
cars
are
available
on
the
island
but
the
bus
and
ferry
service
is
good
So
get
a
multiple
day
buss
ferry
pass
and
enjoy
the
public
transportation
after
perhaps
one
full
day
on
a
pedal
bike
Rentals
are
steep
at
25
a
day
published
but
I
got
the
shop
to
reduce
it
to
15
with
some
quibbling
My
Huffy
18
speed
mountain
bike
was
sufficient
and
you
do
need
those
speeds
on
the
steep
hills
Do
a
lot
of
online
research
on
the
Bermuda
sites
listed
in
the
Guide
when
planning
your
trip
and
email
or
phone
ahead
of
time
as
Bermudians
tend
to
change
printed
schedules
on
a
whim
The
guide
should
emphasize
that
cab
fares
are
very
very
expensive
with
a
minimum
fare
of
about
5
for
a
very
short
ride
to
20
or
more
to
traverse
from
one
hotel
to
another
for
dinner
Cabbies
are
independent
and
subscribe
to
a
call
service
The
other
part
the
guide
left
out
is
that
single
women
are
pursued
by
Bermudans
to
no
end
The
first
question
I
always
seemed
to
get
is
Where
is
your
husband
to
confirm
I
was
fresh
meat
on
the
island
It
seems
that
American
women
traveling
alone
are
curious
commodities
and
perhaps
seen
as
easy
by
local
men
The
other
part
the
guide
leaves
out
is
that
the
tourist
industry
is
heavily
supported
by
guest
workers
from
Europe
Asia
and
Latin
America
making
communication
sometimes
problematic
All
in
all
a
great
source
to
give
you
planning
tools
costs
and
the
inside
scoop
on
the
island

Having
spent
a
lot
of
time
looking
for
information
on
imaginative
fun
and
sometimes
luxury
travel
with
kids
I
can
tell
you
that
this
is
a
really
unique
book
It
is
comprehensive
carefully
researched
and
well
written
with
loads
of
practical
tips
Some
travel
with
kids
books
might
as
well
just
be
bland
advertising
copy
this
one
really
provides
good
editorial
content
with
positive
and
critical
comments
It
is
a
pleasure
to
read
and
we
will
use
it
for
a
long
time
Fodor

of

This
review
is
from
Frommer
s
Florida
with
Your
Family
From
Theme
Park
Fun
to
Sunny
Beach
Getaways
Frommers
With
Your
Family
Series
Paperback
This
is
a
decent
little
book
but
since
it
covers
the
entire
state
it
needs
to
stick
to
the
main
attractions
and
does
not
got
too
deep
into
any
location
There
will
be
just
a
couple
of
recommendations
for
restaurants
for
example
and
attractions
like
Gatorland
are
missing
from
the
Orlando
coverage
Quality
This
book
seems
a
little
more
glossy
than
the
run
of
the
mill
Frommer
s
book
and
it
did
an
excellent
job
when
I
was
flipping
through
and
showing
my
seven
year
old
possible
things
we
could
do
while
on
our
vacation
It
is
not
crammed
with
photos
but
it
has
enough
to
make
page
flipping
worthwhile
Coverage
Since
my
son
is
into
nature
and
fossil
collection
we
needed
a
lot
more
resources
to
find
a
fossil
expedition
and
specific
nature
stops
Also
since
our
trip
was
mainly
concentrating
on
the
southwest
coast
the
other
3
4ths
of
the
book
did
not
help
much
And
as
stated
above
there
were
not
a
whole
lot
of
different
options
this
is
a
pretty
general
book
possibly
because
the
targeted
audience
are
British
vacationers
focusing
on
Disney
and
Universal
theme
parks
The
travel
information
was
decent
although
quaintly
British
again
British
thing
Forgive
me
if
I
am
missing
something
about
Frommers
but
this
book
is
strongly
aimed
at
the
British
visitor
to
Florida
For
the
most
part
this
is
no
problem
as
long
as
you
can
get
over
hire
car
instead
of
rental
car
or
the
idea
of
liquified
baby
food
But
there
is
a
decidedly
British
tilt
to
attraction
selection
as
well
for
example
biplane
rides
for
kids
with
Biggles
fascination
Very
few
kids
on
this
side
of
the
pond
have
any
idea
what
Biggles
is
about
The
book
does
not
say
it
is
written
for
Brits
but
it
seems
to
have
been
Even
tells
you
where
you
can
get
British
newspapers
It
still
worked
for
us
as
a
very
high
level
overview
of
Florida
but
to
match
our
families
interests
we
had
to
go
other
places
as
well
Overall
impression
Decent
book
but
light
on
specifics
or
depth
of
choices
If
you
are
looking
for
off
the
beaten
track
options
you
might
want

This
review
is
from
Going
Places
Family
Getaways
in
the
Pacific
Northwest
Paperback
This
ultimate
guide
for
traveling
in
the
Pacific
Northwest
with
kids
covers
Oregon
Washington
and
British
Columbia
Each
state
province
is
subdivided
into
metropolitan
areas
and
geographical
regions
Then
each
area
or
town
has
listings
for
places
to
stay
places
to
eat
and
things
to
see
and
do
While
this
volume
is
not
exhaustive
in
terms
of
EVERYTHING
you
could
see
or
do
it
certainly
covers
the
highlights
of
things
you
would
enjoy
seeing
and
doing
with
your
children
We
recently
planned
a
trip
to
Oregon
with
a
teenager
using
this
guide
as
one
of
many
resources
We
were
not
disappointed
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
weren
t
able
to
cover
everything
suggested
in
this
book
in
the
time
we
had
available
I
would
suggest
that
these
guides
for
going
places
with
children
work
just
as
well
for
adults
who
want
to
glean
the
highlights
of
locations
they
ll
be
visiting
in
the
Pacific
Northwest
Since
we
were
traveling
with
a
tent
trailer
we
did
not
make
use
of
the
places
to
stay
feature
however
in
glancing
through
them
some
seem
to
be
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
Also
we
discovered
a
great
hamburger
restaurant
in
Bend
Oregon
called
Pilot
Butte
that
was
not
listed
in
this
guide
So
like
I
said
Going
Places
is
not
exhaustive
but
it
certainly
is
helpful

This
is
a
great
reference
book
for
places
to
visit
in
the
Pacific
Northwest
HOWEVER
be
sure
to
call
the
places
you
intend
to
visit
before
you
go
A
lot
of
the
information
is
now
outdated
and
the
prices
are
not
even
remotely
accurate
that
they
have
published
from
2000
We
took
a
trip
to
Portland
to
visit
Farrel
s
Ice
Cream
to
find
it
has
been
out
of
business
for
year
We
called
Yamhill
s
Flying
M
Ranch
about
their
cabins
to
hear
that
must
be
a
really
old
ad
we
don
t
have
cabins
A
trip
this
weekend
to
Astoria
Oregon
we
found
the
locations
they
list
as
free
are
no
longer
free

California
Personal
Injury
Lawyer
Get
you
compensation
you
deserve
Tragically
personal
injury
can
occur
to
anyone
at
any
place
without
any
pre
indication
If
you
have
been
involved
in
an
accident
that
was
occurred
due
to
the
negligence
or
recklessness
of
other
person
you
may
be
eligible
to
recover
compensation
For
car
accident
cases
you
will
usually
be
better
off
with
a
California
car
accident
attorney
But
there
are
different
factors
that
can
contribute
to
the
success
of
your
case
As
a
victim
it
is
essential
for
you
to
find
the
right
California
personal
injury
lawyer
There
are
various
points
you
should
consider
while
hiring
a
personal
injury
attorney
The
most
essential
points
are
the
skill
quality
and
reputation
of
the
California
accident
attorney
you
hire
to
handle
your
case
The
foremost
thing
you
should
do
before
choosing
a
California
personal
injury
lawyer
is
to
ensure
that
the
attorney
s
expertise
and
knowledge
are
satisfactory
to
effectively
protect
your
rights
You
can
also
ask
about
his
success
rate
and
make
inquiries
from
the
State
Bar
of
California
about
any
past
disciplinary
actions
against
him
Next
you
must
personally
fix
an
appointment
with
the
attorney
so
that
you
can
know
more
about
his
background
and
experience
By
doing
this
you
can
make
sure
whether
he
is
able
to
understand
your
case
or
not
After
knowing
the
experience
and
area
of
expertise
of
California
accident
lawyer
you
must
then
make
an
inquiry
about
the
consultation
fees
There
are
many
personal
injury
attorneys
that
offer
a
free
consultation
but
there
are
some
who
do
not
It
is
better
to
confirm
the
cost
of
services
Generally
lawyers
are
paid
at
the
end
of
the
case
by
receiving
a
certain
percentage
of
the
winnings
Make
sure
that
this
percentage
or
other
amount
they
will
charge
is
discussed
and
completely
spelled
out
in
any
agreement
you
sign
with
the
personal
injury
attorney
Based
on
pertinent
documents
and
other
evidence
at
your
disposal
your
personal
injury
will
attempt
to
prove
your
case
The
grounds
for
a
personal
injury
lawsuit
will
vary
from
case
to
case
but
generally
most
personal
injury
lawyers
try
to
prove
that
the
defendant
was
negligent
in
such
a
way
that
harmed
the
plaintiff
Depending
on
a
plaintiff
s
injuries
a
plaintiff
may
recover
general
damages
and
special
damages
General
damages
will
include
an
award
for
pain
and
suffering
while
special
damages
compensate
the
plaintiff
for
medical
expenses
and
lost
earnings
But
remember
every
type
of
claim
has
a
deadline
for
filing
the
claim
in
court
and
this
differ
from
state
to
state
The
time
period
within
which
you
can
bring
a
lawsuit
for
personal
injury
is
known
as
the
Statute
of
Limitations
After
the
expiration
of
this
time
period
the
claim
usually
will
be
vanished
despite
of
its
merits
There
are
different
exceptions
to
the
deadlines
like
minority
incompetency
etc
thus
it
may
still
be
worth
evaluating
a
claim
even
after
the
deadline
has
expired
Thus
after
your
unfortunate
accident
you
must
act
promptly
on
any
claims
which
you
believe
you
may
desire
to
pursue

Tips
for
Getting
Through
a
Deposition
in
a
Personal
Injury
Accident
Case
Posted
by
J
D
Lungren
The
legal
process
can
be
a
maze
of
confusion
and
fear
for
anyone
that
is
not
accustomed
to
navigating
through
it
When
someone
is
involved
in
a
personal
injury
accident
they
suddenly
find
themselves
in
need
pf
a
crash
course
in
the
judicial
process
It
can
be
scary
and
frustrating
Finding
the
right
personal
injury
lawyer
locating
a
doctor
that
is
willing
to
work
with
you
regarding
his
charges
and
worrying
about
losing
your
job
if
you
have
to
miss
work
are
just
a
few
of
the
concerns
that
generally
go
along
with
being
the
victim
in
a
personal
injury
accident
Once
you
have
resolved
the
most
immediate
concerns
the
often
lengthy
process
of
determining
who
was
negligent
at
fault
and
then
what
your
claim
is
worth
begins
Lawyer
use
a
number
of
tactics
to
try
and
determine
who
was
at
fault
and
then
what
the
victim
s
claim
is
worth
One
common
legal
process
used
by
attorneys
in
a
personal
injury
accident
case
is
to
take
the
deposition
of
the
victim
A
deposition
is
a
way
for
the
lawyers
to
take
the
testimony
of
a
witness
prior
to
an
actual
trial
It
is
more
formal
than
an
office
interview
but
less
formal
than
a
trial
The
testimony
that
you
give
at
a
deposition
is
taken
under
oath
and
can
be
introduced
at
trial
in
most
cases
In
some
cases
a
witnesses
deposition
testimony
can
even
be
introduced
at
trial
if
the
witness
later
becomes
unavailable
The
idea
of
a
deposition
can
be
frightening
for
anyone
that
is
unfamiliar
with
the
process
If
you
are
scheduled
for
a
deposition
or
have
a
personal
injury
accident
case
that
could
require
a
deposition
consider
the
following
tips
when
preparing
for
the
deposition
1
Be
informed
Your
personal
injury
attorney
should
help
inform
you
about
the
procedures
involved
in
a
deposition
who
will
be
there
where
it
will
be
held
how
long
it
should
take
etc
As
a
rule
the
defendant
plaintiff
and
their
attorneys
as
well
as
a
court
reporter
will
be
present
The
length
of
the
deposition
can
vary
greatly
depending
on
the
issues
in
your
case
Spend
as
much
time
as
you
need
asking
your
attorney
questions
so
that
you
feel
well
informed
prior
to
the
deposition
2
Practice
An
experienced
personal
injury
attorney
will
generally
spend
some
time
with
his
client
practicing
before
an
actual
deposition
Time
spent
answering
questions
that
are
likely
to
be
asked
at
the
deposition
will
make
you
feel
much
more
at
ease
during
the
actual
deposition
3
Tell
the
truth
Remember
that
a
deposition
is
taken
under
oath
This
means
that
the
answers
you
give
during
a
deposition
may
be
able
to
be
used
in
an
actual
trial
if
you
answer
the
same
question
differently
at
trial
If
you
are
unsure
how
to
answer
a
question
or
are
afraid
to
answer
a
question
consult
with
your
attorney
that
s
why
he
is
there

There
is
no
point
in
living
a
compromised
lifestyle
after
an
accident
especially
when

your
fault
However
you
need
to
prove
your
innocence
and
other
party
s
responsibility
in

To
do
so
you
need
to
gather
records
in
support

of
police
report
statement
of
eye
witnesses
etc

the
most
common
evidence
that
may
help
victims
to
get
justice
However
all
the
evidence
should
be
obtained
in
accordance
with
legal
guideline
You
cannot
show
anything
in
court
as
evidence
it
should
be
collected
in
proper
manner
otherwise
court
of
law
won
t
accept
it
as
a
legal
evidence
Hence
you
need
to
work
with
a
lawyer
Legal
guidance
Personal

lawyers
Attorneys
who
have
been
working
on
personal
injury
cases
for
years
know
how
to
collect
evidence
properly

probe
the
case
thoroughly
and
the
report
is
submitted
at
court
Therefore
personal
injury
lawyers
are
the
best
persons
to
contact
when
it
comes
to
get
justice
Make
sure
you
deal
with
a
lawyer
of
your
state
Personal

differ
from
state
to
state
laws
of
Florida
may
be
different
from
that
of

Personal

Lawsuit
Filed
After
Extra
Hurt
Filming
Transformers
3
Posted
by
J
D
Lungren
While
making
a
film
creates
loads
of
stress
for
movie
producers
tragic
accidents
are
rarely
a
cause
for
their
concern
However
a
recent
incident
on
the
set
of
Transformers
3
has
left
a
rippling
effect
on
the
filmmakers
and
severely
impacted
the
life
of
one
injured
extra
According
to
reports
the
family
of
Gabriella
Cedillo
recently
filed
a
personal
injury
lawsuit
against
the
makers
of
the
movie
alleging
that
their
negligence
resulted
in
Cedillo
s
severe
brain
injury
The
lawsuit
was
filed
in
the
Cook
County
Circuit
Court
in
Chicago
Illinois
The
details
of
the
accident
are
shocking
For
the
stunt
Cedillo
who
had
just
turned
24
years
old
was
driving
her
own
car
in
a
vacated
part
of
a
downtown
avenue
in
Hammond
Indiana
Sources
indicate
that
Cedillo
was
among
80
other
extras
driving
along
the
same
stretch
of
road
While
she
was
driving
empty
stunt
vehicles
were
being
towed
by
flatbed
trucks
in
the
opposite
direction
at
speeds
reaching
50
miles
per
hour
The
scene
in
question
required
one
of
these
stunt
vehicles
to
be
lifted
into
the
air
and
flipped
with
the
aid
of
an
intricate
series
of
cables
Unfortunately
on
the
day
of
the
accident
the
bracket
attached
to
one
of
the
flying
cars
snapped
sending
the
vehicle
flying
towards
Cedillo
s
car
Shortly
thereafter
a
metal
object
slammed
through
Cedillo
s
windshield
causing
irreparable
brain
damage
Cedillo
has
been
in
the
hospital
since
her
on
the
job
injury
and
is
paralyzed
on
her
left
side
though
she
has
been
able
to
write
a
few
words

Car
Accident
Lawsuit
Leads
to
20
Million
Personal
Injury
Settlement
Posted
by
In
2008
a
freak
car
accident
resulted
in
a
severe
brain
injury
for
a
Wisconsin
toddler
A
recent
personal
injury
settlement
ensures
that
the
little
girl
s
family
will
be
able
to
pay
her
medical
expenses
for
life
The
Green
Bay
Press
Gazette
indicate
that
the
personal
injury
settlement
which
was
reached
between
the
family
and
several
responsible
parties
was
worth
a
total
of
20
million
This
lofty
sum
is
a
record
injury
settlement
in
Outagamie
County
Wisconsin
topping
the
previous
largest
settlement
by
several
million
dollars
The
accident
that
injured
the
young
girl
only
two
years
old
at
the
time
was
relatively
minor
A
large
truck
owned
by
a
well
drilling
company
ran
a
red
light
but
applied
its
breaks
well
before
hitting
the
girls
mother
s
minivan
Even
though
the
impact
of
the
crash
was
not
severe
a
pipe
rack
attached
to
the
truck
came
loose
and
several
pipes
crashed
through
the
windows
of
the
car
One
of
these
pipes
tragically
struck
the
young
girl
in
the
head
Her
family
s
personal
injury
lawsuit
alleged
that
the
pipe
rack
collapsed
because
of
faulty
design
by
the
manufacturer
As
a
result
of
the
pipe
s
impact
the
girl
suffered
permanent
injuries
including
traumatic
epilepsy
and
blindness
According
to
reports
of
the
personal
injury
settlement
the
girl
s
medical
expenses
totaled
almost
900
000
in
the
two
years
since
the
accident
occurred
The
settlement
money
will
be
paid
by
multiple
parties
The
manufacturer
of
the
pipe
rack
that
failed
is
on
the
hook
for
roughly
300
000
In
addition
the
driver
of
the
truck
and
the
truck
company
are
liable
for
about
1
million
of
the
settlement
s
total
fund
The
rest
of
the
total
some
18
7
million
will
be
paid
by
the
distributor
of
the
pipe
rack

How

A
mammogram
is
one
of
the
safest
ways
that
is
used
to
check
if
there
is
any
problem
with
the
breast
of
a
woman
It
is
actually
an
x
ray
of
the
breasts
as
it
involves
in
using
a
special
and
very
low
dose
x
ray
machine
taking
pictures
of
both
breasts
Effective
Method
of
Preventing
Cancer
Mammogram
is
an
effective
way
of
breast
cancer
prevention
as
it
is
the
most
reliable
procedure
to
detect
early
stages
of
breast
cancer
However
there
are
some
limitations
of
mammogram
Many
cancers
may
not
be
detected
by
mammograms
Such
breast
cancers
can
be
detected
by
breast
self
exam
This
article
will
guide
you
in
getting
ready
for
your
mammogram
What
You
Should
Watch
Out
For
Firstly
you
should
check
the
place
where
you
are
going
to
have
your
mammogram
so
that
you
get
to
know
about
any
special
instructions
which
you
must
follow
before
you
arrive
there
You
should
make
the
appointment
for
your
mammogram
for
at
least
one
week
after
the
completion
of
your
period
This
is
because
your
breast
generally
hurt
less
during
this
time
You
should
make
sure
that
you
tell
your
mammography
facility
if
you
have
ever
got
any
type
of
breast
implants

What
Are
the
Six
Commonly
Used
Chemotherapy
Agents

Mesothelioma
cancer
can
be
treated
by
the
use
of
anti
cancer
drug
therapies
These
anti
cancer
drugs
act
by
inhibiting
tumor
growth
through
the
blocking
of
cell
division
and
multiplication
This
mode
of
action
also
unfortunately
affects
other
rapidly
replicating
cells
in
the
body
cells
of
the
hair
and
the
lining
of
the
intestine
are
particularly
vulnerable
thus
leading
to
the
common
side
effects
of
anti
cancer
drugs
like
hair
loss
and
nausea
Mesothelioma
is
notoriously
resistant
to
common
anti
cancer
chemotherapy
as
result
of
some
reasons
The
cancer
takes
a
long
time
to
mature
and
show
symptoms
by
the
time
these
symptoms
appear
the
tumor
will
be
well
formed
with
a
lot
of
layers
of
dead
cells
that
the
anti
cancer
drugs
will
find
it
difficult
to
penetrate
and
also
by
the
time
a
diagnosis
of
mesothelioma
is
made
most
victims
have
but
a
short
time
left
to
live
so
the
drugs
do
not
have
enough
time
to
exert
their
maximal
effect
New
drugs
that
have
been
designed
to
overcome
these
challenges
and
have
fewer
and
lesser
side
effects
include
Alimta
Pemetrexed
Alimta
was
approved
by
The
Food
and
Drug
Administration
in
February
2004
as
a
new
anti
cancer
drug
for
the
treatment
of
mesothelioma
Its
mode
of
action
is
by
inhibiting
the
creation
of
thymidine
and
purine
two
enzymes
that
are
vital
to
cell
growth
This
stops
the
mesothelioma
cancer
cells
from
multiplying
at
a
very
fast
rate
Its
side
effects
include
nausea
and
vomiting
diarrhea
fatigue
mouth
sores
and
low
blood
counts
Patients
are
usually
placed
on
vitamin
B12
and
folic
acid
supplements
to
reduce
the
severity
of
the
side
effects

How
Does
the
Medicare

Mesothelioma

The
Part
D
drug
benefit
is
prescription
drug
coverage
for
people
with
Medicare
Medicare
offers
Part
D
to
everyone
with
Medicare
People
enrolled
in
Medicare
are
called
Medicare
beneficiaries
Part
D
coverage
may
help
you
lower
your
prescription
drug
costs
and
help
protect
you
from
higher
costs
in
the
future
It
can
give
you
greater
access
to
the
anti
cancer
drugs
you
need
to
treat
your
cancer
To
get
Medicare
Part
D
drug
coverage
you
must
join
a
plan
that
is
run
by
an
insurance
company
or
other
private
company
that
has
been
approved
by
Medicare
If
you
join
a
Medicare
drug
plan
you
usually
pay
a
monthly
premium
If
you
decide
not
to
join
a
Medicare
drug
plan
when
you
are
first
eligible
able
to
join
you
may
pay
a
penalty
if
you
decide
to
join
later
If
your
income
and
resources
are
limited
you
might
qualify
for
extra
help
paying
Part
D
costs
There
are
different
plans
that
vary
in
cost
and
the
type
of
drugs
that
are
covered
by
each
plan
and
it
is
hard
to
compare
them
As
a
mesothelioma
cancer
patient
your
may
incur
huge
annual
drug
expenses
so
it
is
important
to
look
at
each
plan
s
coverage
as
well
as
your
cost
sharing
obligations
during
coverage
gaps
Coverage
gaps
are
dollar
limits
that
when
reached
leave
you
responsible
for
some
or
all
of
the
drug
costs
The
coverage
gap
or
donut
hole
is
the
gap
in
which
you
must
pay
100
of
your
prescription
costs
Once
your
total
drug
costs
what
you
and
the
plan
pay
for
your
prescriptions
reach
a
pre
set
dollar
amount
for
the
year
you
will
hit
the
donut
hole
Then
you
will
pay
all
of
your
drug
costs
until
the
total
out
of
pocket
costs
reaches
another
pre
set
amount
Reaching
this
amount
triggers
what
is
called
catastrophic
coverage
After
that
Medicare
Part
D
will
cover
95
of
your
drug
costs
and
you
will
pay
a
flat
co
pay
or
5
of
the
cost
of
the
drug
for
the
rest
of
that
year
Keep
in
mind
that
some
cancer
drugs
cost
a
lot
and
5
can
be
several
hundred
dollars
a
month
If
your
drug
plan
has
a
coverage
gap
here
are
some
ways
you
can
avoid
or
delay
entering
the
gap
and
save
money
on
drug
costs
while
in
the
gap

How
To
Write
Your
Last
Will
and
Testament
Posted
by
I
was
speaking
with
a
woman
about
a
month
ago
she
was
looking
for
coverage
for
her
final
expenses
When
we
met
she
was
in
her
front
yard
tending
her
snake
hydrangeas
ferns
and
spider
plants
and
as
we
conversed
she
told
me
she
transplants
at
least
once
per
year
because
she
uses
fertilizer
to
help
her
plants
grow
Widowed
with
grown
children
living
and
working
away
from
home
she
owns
her
small
home
mortgage
completed
and
a
small
car
Middle
aged
and
in
good
health
I
discovered
that
my
new
acquaintance
surprisingly
however
is
not
unlike
many
Americans
She
does
not
have
a
will
According
to
a
FindLaw
com
survey
conducted
June
of
2008
nearly
60
percent
of
Americans
do
not
have
a
will
Although
more
than
half
of
the
persons
surveyed
aged
50
or
older
had
a
will
that
percentage
declined
to
25
percent
of
persons
with
a
will
aged
25
to
34
Persons
in
the
survey
between
the
ages
of
18
and
24
those
with
a
will
is
less
than
ten
percent
Very
few
of
us
spend
our
daily
lives
thinking
about
death
Even
fewer
think
about
what
it
is
we
would
like
to
leave
our
children
or
our
loved
ones
In
talking
with
people
about
their
final
expenses
if
they
have
thought
about
the
cost
of
a
funeral
they
have
not
thought
about
what
happens
after
they
have
left
us
A
sobering
but
necessary
thought
I
have
found
that
the
younger
my
acquaintance
is
the
less
chance
there
is
that
the
words
death
and
will
are
in
their
vocabulary
So
you
if
you
say
you
don
t
have
a
will
my
immediate
question
is
why
not
I
was
told
by
one
person
Well
I
don
t
own
anything
what
do
I
need
a
will
for
Well
if
you
are
a
home
owner
or
you
are
a
business
owner
a
will
is
not
only
prudent
but
necessary
especially
if
your
financial
empire
has
residual
income

Denver
Wrongful
Death
Attorney
Consult
him
before
it
s
too
Late
Posted
by
A
wrongful
death
can
occur
due
to
various
reasons
In
some
cases
the
actual
reason
does
not
get
established
and
some
questions
remain
unanswered
as
to
who
is
to
be
blamed
for
such
accident
This
kind
of
death
happens
mostly
due
to
the
negligence
committed
by
the
third
party
and
requires
an
immediate
consultation
of
a
Denver
Wrongful
Death
Attorney
which
is
usually
free
initially

the
wrongful
death
of
a
hospital
patient
the
culprits
can
be
hospital
authorities
who
always
put
their
staff
under
tremendous
pressure
and
as
a
result
mistakes
are
bound
to
happen
The
concerned
staff
may
provide
wrong
drugs
to
the
patient
which
can
result
in
death
In
case
of
the
wrongful
death
at
a
workplace
where
hazardous
activities
take
place
such
as
mining
transportation
construction
or
fire
fighting
the
fall
of
an
object
explosion
or
any
other
kind
of
accident
can
take
place
which
results
in
death
In
case
of
activities
where
people
use
modified
equipment
or
vehicle
in
automobile
race
boating
diving
paragliding
etc
accidents
are
bound
to
take
place
resulting
in
death
due
to
excessive
use
of
equipment
beyond
the
specified
capacity
to
achieve
the
desired
result
In
case
of
transportation
industry
trucks
or
other
heavy
carriers
are
quite
often
studded
with
excessive
goods
which
are
beyond
the
load
bearing
capacity
The
drivers
might
loose
the
balance
and
commit

The

The
Terry
Schiavo
case
of
life
death
and
the
wishes
of
someone
who
is
terminally
ill
has
not
quite
left
our
memory
For
15
years
opposite
sides
of
a
life
and
death
struggle
involving
Terry
Schiavo
who
in
February
of
1990
at
age
26
collapsed
in
her
apartment
lapsed
into
a
coma
and
only
recovered
to
a
vegetative
state
fought
through
numerous
court
appearances
and
with
each
other
in
family
battles
that
resulted
in
a
debate
fueled
by
money
powered
advocates
from
both
pro
life
and
right
to
die
camps
The
debate
also
went
to
the
US
Congress
and
prompted
a
statement
by
then
President
George
Bush
who
said
that
because
there
were
serious
questions
and
substantial
doubts
about
the
case
Terri
Schiavo
had
no
written
directive
as
to
whether
she
would
wish
to
have
her
feeding
tube
removed
or
not
The
Schiavo
Family
s
insistence
that
Terry
wanted
to
remain
alive
and
Terry
s
husband
Michael
Schiavo
s
wish
to
allow
his
wife
to
die
a
natural
death
could
have
been
avoided
with
one
simple
documentation
I
m
sure
you
know
someone
who
has
been
in
this
situation
if
you
have
not
been
in
this
situation
yourself
You
ve
been
seriously
ill
and
are
in
the
hospital
A
nurse
after
checking
your
vitals
says
there
are
some
papers
for
you
to
sign
it
has
to
do
with
your
scheduled
surgery
These
papers
must
be
signed
or
the
surgery
you
need
won
t
be
performed
She

be
back
later
to
collect
them
with

You

these
papers
before
and
so

The

Monge
Atlanta
Wrongful
Death
Lawyer
Posted
by
Life
can
turn
bitter
when
we
experience
the
death
of
a
loved
one
much
less
when
they
die
because
of
the
negligence
or
reckless
actions
of
someone
else
Though
very
difficult
to
deal
with
emotionally
this
appalling
situation
has
been
experienced
by
too
many
families
that
s
why
Scott
Monge
a
wrongful
death
attorney
is
here
to
help
Though
most
people
tend
to
think
of
a
hospital
nursing
home
or
workplace
when
they
hear
of
a
wrongful
death
tragedy
the
truth
is
it
can
happen
because
of
simple
failures
to
make
sure
safety
has
been
addressed
such
as
at
a
construction
site
shopping
at
the
mall
on
a
faulty
escalator
or
even
because
of
a
negligent
landlord
who
never
listened
when
your
loved
one
reported
that
his
or
her
apartment
had
a
bad
odor
Whatever
the
case
families
are
unprepared
to
deal
with
going
after
those
responsible
amid
the
grief
and
anger
they
will
also
have
to
endure
Worse
still
for
those
who
seek
redress
on
their
own
from
the
companies
or
individuals
directly
responsible
for
their
spouse
or
family
member
s
death
it
is
often
a
painful
battle
that
takes
a
harsh
emotional
and
financial
toll
on
their
lives
The
culpable
companies
can
be
hostile
to
you
and
your
questions
They
will
try
to
confuse
you
deceive
you
and
could
even
blame
the
wrongful
death
on
the
deceased
Scott
Monge
is
familiar
with
all
these
demeaning
tactics
he
has
seen
them
employed
time
and
time
again
against
innocent
families
who
are
just
trying
get
some
justice
As
a
wrongful
death
attorney
who
has
been
helping
families
in
the
metro
Atlanta
area
and
throughout
the
state
of
Georgia
for
years
to
combat
these
big
corporations
he
has
seen
every
disgusting
trick
in
their
book
He
has
successfully
won
millions
of
dollars
for
his
clients
so
they
can
start
to
recover
and
to
mitigate
against
the
costs
associated
with
the
loss
of
a
vital
working
family
member
The
negligent
reckless
practices
of
individuals
and
the
companies
they
represent
from
doctors
nurses
home
health
and
nursing
health
care
professionals
to
foremen
landlords
and
safety
inspection
personnel
have
tremendous
consequences
As
such
what
they
do
is
regulated
monitored
and
subject
to
various
codes
and
laws
to
protect
the
average
person
worker
Scott
Monge
will
fight
to
protect
your
rights
against
those
responsible
for
your
family
member
s
death
and
he
will
aggressively
deal
with
the
unfair
tactics
employed
by
their
legal
representatives
His
team
has
30
combined
years
of
experience
behind
them
In
fact
the
only
cases
Scott
Monge
and
his
associates
take
on
are
those
related
to
personal
injury
including
those
that
result
in
wrongful
death
This
is
the
kind
of
concentrated
skill
you
want
to
have
at
your
disposal
if
you
are
prepared
to
take
those
responsible
to
court
to
pay
for
their
negligence
indifference
or
recklessness

Take
the
Help
of
Auto
Accident
Attorney
for
Adequate
Recompense
Injury
attorney
Posted
by
The
cases
of
vehicle
collision
and
violation
of
traffic
laws
have
become
very
usual
in
the
highly
populated
cities
like
Orlando
in
the
USA
They
have
become
more
serious
for
the
victim
when
he
or
she
does
not
get
the
adequate
compensation
but
an
evocative
response
on
the
spot
So
it
s
very
natural
to
contact
an
Orlando
lawyer
for
the
purpose
The
damage
caused
by
the
rash
driving
of
some
miscreants
can
provoke
anybody
and
encourage
anybody
to
take
law
into
their
hands
but
remember
your
actions
can
spoil
the
case
of
accident
and
you
might
be
deterred
from
the
benefits
of
your
rights
Have
a
brief
look
at
some
intricacies
attracted
to
the
cases
of
car
accidents
and
what
is
the
role
of
auto
accident
attorney
in
giving
you
justice
after
that
Orlando
roads
and
freeways
are
notorious
for
its
vehicle
collision
cases
and
violation
of
traffic
rules
Each
year
there
are
thousands
of
car
accident
cases
in
media
some
are
registered
and
some
pass
by
unregistered
Here
the
cases
of
wrecks
on
highways
bridges
roadways
and
freeways
have
become
a
cause
of
big
concern
for
the
residents
and
travelers
The
increasing
number
of
vehicle
collision
cases
in
the
office
of
Orlando
lawyers
can
open
your
eyes
and
then
you
can
realize
how
arduous
their
jobs
are
bringing
the
culprit
to
justice
From
the
victim
s
point
of
view
they
want
compensation
for
the
dent
occurred
due
to
the
accident
and
do
not
want
to
drag
the
case
on
for
long
When
an
Orlando
attorney
handles
the
cases
of
such
accidents
it
requires
certain
evidence
in
order
to
strengthen
the
claim
of
prosecutors
The
first
impromptu
action
expected
from
the
victims
is
that
they
must
have
appropriate
evidence
of
the
damage
in
terms
of
photographs
voice
bytes
of
the
witnesses
and
name
and
address
of
the
person
who
caused
accidents
Furthermore
to
support
Orlando
lawyer
s
claim
in
the
court
you
have
to
have
the
medical
proof
of
pains
bruise
cuts
or
any
other
physical
damage
caused
by
the
damage

I
am
a
Judgment
Broker
not
a
lawyer
and
this
article
is
my
opinion
please
consult
with
a
lawyer
if
you
need
legal
advice
This
article
only
covers
how
a
judgment
debtor
s
actual
address
might
be
discovered
so
a
process
server
can
serve
legal
papers
on
them
USPS
boxes
and
Private
Mail
Boxes
PMBs
are
becoming
more
and
more
popular
the
main
reasons
are
because
they
help
people
increase
their
personal
privacy
and
safety
People
want
privacy
especially
people
that
owe
money
on
civil
judgments
More
and
more
people
are
using
private
post
office
box
stores
such
as
The
UPS
Store
because
they
usually
have
more
features
at
a
better
price
than
the
USPS
post
office
offers
Some
judgment
debtors
go
to
great
lengths
to
live
off
the
grid
and
they
try
to
make
only
their
post
office
box
show
up
on
any
public
record
data
searches
To
recover
a
judgment
often
you
must
personally
serve
the
debtor
to
compel
them
and
sometimes
third
parties
to
appear
in
court
to
try
to
discover
information
that
may
lead
to
the
debtor
s
available
assets
When
a
debtor
goes
to
great
lengths
to
hide
behind
a
PO
box
or
a
PMB
one
usually
must
hire
someone
to
find
the
debtor
s
other
physical
address
hopefully
the
address
that
the
debtor
lives
at
To
find
this
information
you
can
either
hire
a
private
investigator
or
a
lawyer
or
you
can
save
money
and
hire
a
process
server
The
only
reason
you
can
get
this
private
information
from
a
process
server
is
for
the
service
of
legal
process

It
happens
every
day
a
fall
from
a
ladder
electrocution
equipment
failure
grave
injuries
from
workplace
accidents
and
misjudgments
If
in
the
course
of
performing
your
job
you
are
injured
you
may
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
take
legal
action
against
your
employer
Naturally
accidents
happen
and
a
staple
in
the
finger
while
quite
painful
does
not
constitute
a
lawsuit
But
serious
injury
can
occur
and
often
a
workers
compensation
claim
is
the
only
answer
It
will
be
well
worth
your
time
and
effort
to
challenge
an
employer
for
compensation
in
the
event
you
are
hurt
on
the
job
and
are
temporarily
or
permanently
unable
to
do
your
job
First
be
aware
that
in
case
of
injury
you
must
notify
the
employer
as
soon
as
possible
about
the
incident
State
clearly
in
writing
the
basic
who
when
where
what
of
the
accident
and
what
consequences
you
have
suffered
as
a
result
Even
if
you
re
sure
the
employer
is
aware
of
the
incident
an
ambulance
was
called
for
example
you
must
submit
a
written
report
of
the
event
This
will
help
if
you
hire
an
attorney
for
a
workers
compensation
suit
The
laws
are
complex
in
North
Carolina
as
in
any
other
state
and
it
pays
to
hire
expert
assistance
for
the
claim
process
or
subsequent
lawsuit
For
example
there
are
workers
compensation
laws
pertaining
to
time
limitations
for
compensation
starting
and
ending
There
are
codified
guidelines
for
compensation
for
various
injuries
and
degree
of
injury
whole
finger
vs
partial
amputation
vision
impairment
or
total
sight
loss
guidelines
for
total
or
partial
disfigurement
and
codes
addressing
diseases
caused
by
the
workplace
such
as
silicosis
and
asbestosis
There
are
laws
to
address
circumstances
whereby
an
employee
has
a
pre
existing
condition
epilepsy
for
example
and
injured
on
the
job
There
are
laws
addressing
a
right
to
a
trial
return
to
work
period
of
9
months
after
an
injury
Additional
laws
speak
to
dependents
of
deceased
employees
and
lump
sums
vs
periodic
payouts
You
need
a
workers
compensation
lawyer
to
help
make
sense
of
it
all
and
to
help
you
get
on
with
your
life
In
Raleigh

A
professional
car
accident
lawyer
advice
and
guidance
is
of
incalculable
importance
to
the
client
who
is
caught
in
the
middle
of
a
legal
implication
Though
legal
matters
do
take
time
to
fold
up
but
the
quality
and
tenure
of
supervision
not
only
helps
the
client
financially
and
in
recovering
with
all
aid
possible
from
the
government
but
more
so
it
also
helps
set
an
example
for
all
involved
in
the
vast
number
of
motorcar
accidents
that
take
place
every
year
Without
the
professional
guidance
of
an
experienced
lawyer
for
motorcar
accidents
it
does
not
ensure
a
smooth
legal
proceeding
from
which
the
client
can
be
assured
of
total
recovery
and
complete
safety
To
start
with
the
place
and
venue
of
the
accident
needs
to
be
correctly
captured
in
detail
This
needs
to
be
done
both
in
order
to
report
the
case
with
police
as
well
as
for
insurance
purposes
As
such
all
evidence
and
events
of
the
occurring
incident
need
to
be
detailed
while
being
captured
It
is
here
that
the
invaluable
expertise
of
the
lawyer
acting
for
motorcar
accidents
comes
into
the
picture
All
names
and
contact
information
of
witnesses
along
with
others
involved
in
line
with
information
regarding
the
damaged
vehicles
involved
need
to
be
captured
In
today
s
mobile
age
photographs
collected
on
the
spot
with
help
of
mobile
phone
cameras
can
come
in
very
handy
to
the
car
accident
lawyer
later
on
Moving
further
the
entire
procedure
of
tackling
the
insurance
companies
is
a
huge
task
and
needs
the
experience
of
a
professional
to
handle
the
associated
formalities
and
ensure
the
claim
is
realized
in
full
For
this
arduous
task
the
lawyer
who
is
well
equipped
with
all
insurance
related
developments
is
indispensable
On
the
financial
front
any
claims
that
are
to
be
derived
from
the
contesting
party
is
also
the
responsibility
of
the
lawyer
involved
Over
here
it
is
not
only
the
sum
of
money
to
be
claimed
that
is
at
stake
but
also
the
manner
in
which
this
has
to
be
realized
A
car
accident
lawyer
for
motorcar
accidents
who
is
well
versed
with
the
existing
norms
and
prevailing
trends
in
this
line
will
carry
out
all
the
formalities
in
a
smooth
way
consuming
the
least
of
time
Further
more
a
firm
vigil
on
all
that
needs
to
be
disclosed
to
the
insurance
companies
is
also
atop
the
list
of
priorities
for
the
prosecutions
by
them
A
car
accident
lawyer
working
in
motorcar
accidents
do
charge
fees
that
raise
an
eyebrow
and
at
times
they
can
be
on
a
percentage
basis
of
the
recovered
amount
in
concern
However
what
we
need
to
be
aware
of
is
that
the
client
stands
to
gain
both
monetarily
and
in
health
before
the
money
actually
goes
into
the
pockets
of
the
lawyer
With
indefinite
limits
of
insurance
amounts
on
question
a
resourceful
lawyer
can
go
quite
a
distance
in
helping
the
client
recover
the
claim
amount
in
full
In
fact
there
have
been
instances
where
multiple
sources
of
claim
and
settlement
have
arisen
which
in
turn
turnout
as
windfall
sources
of
income
However
they
are
made
to
happen
only
with
the
keen
eye
of
a
car
accident
lawyer
for
detail
of
the
costly
services
of
the
legal
aid
The
claim
in
return
not
only
affects
the
party
on
suit
but
also
to
all
the
indirectly
related
distant
relations
like
the
collective
owners
of
the
accident
met

all
government
authorities
manufacturing
company
of
the
automobile
and
lastly

involved
employers

Ronald
Reagan
Overview
Injury
lawyer
Posted
by
Ronald
Reagan
was
a
fascinating
man
well
before
he
became
a
fascinating
president
Jules
Tygiel
offers
a
rare
semi
unbiased
look
into
Ronald
Reagan
s
life
before
during
and
after
his
presidency
Tygiel
confronts
the
reader
with
the
perception
of
Reagan
as
a
person
with
no
depth
or
unique
ideas
of
his
own
and
gives
us
all
the
tools
in
Reagan
s
life
that
molded
such
a
personality
Tygiel
offers
detailed
analysis
of
Reagan
s
life
and
gives
the
reader
a
chance
to
explain
for
themselves
Reagan
s
abrupt
change
in
political
beliefs
and
liberal
ideals
While
at
times
utterly
confusing
it
is
also
not
difficult
to
understand
Reagan
s
stance
of
the
moment
when
you
remember
his
desire
to
please
and
be
seen
in
the
most
admirable
light
by
others
While
reviewing
Reagan
s
life
one
cannot
help
but
be
either
incensed
or
envious
of
his
uncanny
ability
to
escape
reality
and
deliver
fantasy
to
an
eager
people
Tygiel
states
that
Reagan
s
abrupt
political
changes
seem
to
have
no
rhyme
or
reason
to
support
them
However
Tygiel
also
implies
that
Reagan
s
political
changes
were
initially
deceptive
and
later
opportunistic
Reagan
s
father
Jack
Reagan
is
portrayed
as
an
Irish
Catholic
alcoholic
which
Ronald
Reagan
referred
to
as
his
father
s
weakness
Tygiel
displays
Jack
Reagan
as
a
hard
working
semi
ambitious
man
who
had
a
problem
with
alcohol
Jack
Reagan
s
personal
beliefs
were
strongly
aligned
with
the
Democratic
Party
Tygiel
mentions
Jack
Reagan
s
refusal
to
patronage
shops
with
known
anti
Semitic
views
Jack
Reagan
was
willing
to
inconvenience
himself
in
order
to
make
a
political
statement
In
contrast
while
Ronald
Reagan
stated
to
have
his
father
s
same
democratic
beliefs
he
was
not
as
willing
to
inconvenience
himself
to
make
a
political
statement
Tygiel
gives
the
example
of
the
African
American
players
on
Ronald
Reagan
s
school
football
team
being
denied
lodging
in
a
hotel
The
coach
was
furious
and
insisted
that
the
entire
team
sleep
on
the
bus
and
make
a
political
stand
by
doing
such
Ronald
Reagan
instead
offered
the
African
American
players
a
room
in
his
home
to
avoid
such
a
controversial
issue
This
causes
one
to
question
Ronald
s
true
political
beliefs
Tygiel
also
questions
the
true
democratic
beliefs
of
Ronald
when
Jack
Reagan
dies
While
demonstrating
the
sense
of
betrayal
felt
by
Jack
Reagan
when
his
son
Neil
starts
speaking
about
his
republican
beliefs
Tygiel
shows
how
deep
Jack
Reagan
s
political
beliefs
travel
Tygiel
states
that
Ronald
felt
a
sense
of
relief
when
his
father
passed
away
because
he
no
longer
had
to
fear
disappointing
him
with
his
political
views

About
Product
Liability
Lawyers
Personal
injury
lawyers
Posted
by
Product
liabilities
attorneys
are
attorneys
that
focus
on
this
area
of
the
law
In
the
event
you
have
been
injured
by
an
item
you
might
be
eligible
to
sue
for
damages
and
include
the
vendor
of
the
product
distributor
as
well
as
the
retail
outlet
for
any
damages
experienced
by
the
consumer
The
attorney
will
represent
their
clients
in
these
cases
These
legal
professionals
take
on
a
number
of
different
kinds
of
cases
such
as
catastrophic
injuries
lawyer
s
would
work
with
They
have
a
great
deal
of
expertise
in
the
field
and
will
seek
out
damages
regarding
products
that
have
injured
a
client
due
to
a
defect
Manufacturers
carry
a
legal
responsibility
for
their
goods
Such
attorneys
may
have
experience
in
coping
with
customer
merchandise
recalls
when
certain
dangers
are
apparent
towards
the
public
They
may
be
also
employed
to
dealing
with
much
more
delicate
cases
where
the
responsibility
associated
with
proof
is
on
the
consumer
of
the
item
There
are
many
legal
professionals
that
specialize
in
this
area
This
type
of
attorney
may
also
know
about
specific
legal
terms
for
cases
where
customer
item
liability
isn
t
clearly
apparent
or
well
defined
In
some
of
these
cases
the
issue
is
not
really
the
actual
inherent
risk
of
the
item
However
it
is
important
to
be
sure
the
item
was
properly
used
by
the
consumer
In
these
cases
issues
just
like
a
insufficient
warning
label
might
be
central
to
some
item
liability
cases
In
this
situation
an
attorney
will
aim
to
show
inadequate
information
on
proper
use
relayed
to
the
client
which
equates
to
negligence
for
the
producer
There
are
many
different
types
of
cases
involving
this
type
of
law
They
must
be
very
careful
at
each
stage
associated
with
production
for
security
purpose
If
anything
that
violates
the
law
is
discovered
their
license
might
be
suspended
or
terminated
and
all
their
products
could
be
recalled
Those
who
have
suffered
from
these
items
can
file
payment
suits
against
all
responsible
parties
through

Spinal
injuries
staying
positive
about
life
Injury
lawyer
Posted
by
Coping
with
the
aftermath
of
a
serious
injury
isn
t
just
a
matter
of
physical
recovery
For
the
victims
of
life
changing
injuries
such
as
spinal
injury
there
often
needs
to
be
a
psychological
adjustment
too
as
they
come
to
terms
with
the
change
in
circumstances
and
the
trauma
of
the
event
itself
Why
me
Once
the
physical
recovery
has
started
victims
of
spinal
injuries
can
often
fall
into
a
cycle
of
depression
particularly
if
the
injury
means
a
complete
alteration
of
their
lifestyle
For
victims
who
may
have
been
very
physically
active
before
their
accident
the
knowledge
that
they
are
now
restricted
in
what
they
can
do
and
achieve
has
very
real
implications
to
their
psychological
wellbeing
In
this
context
the
question
why
me
is
often
asked
Unfortunately
there
is
no
reply
to
that
question
that
will
give
the
victim
any
comfort
But
what
families
and
friends
can
do
is
to
help
the
victim
focus
on
a
new
question
what
next
Giving
the
victim
time
to
adjust
Time
is
supposed
to
be
a
great
healer
One
thing
that
spinal
injury
victims
need
is
the
time
to
adjust
to
their
new
life
after
a
serious
accident
Because
of
the
nature
of
spinal
injuries
victims
may
need
longer
than
most
to
come
to
terms
with
the
fundamental
changes
that
a
life
restricted
by
the
long
term
effects
of
a
spinal
injury
can
bring
During
that
period
the
most
important
thing
a
victim
will
need
is
support
from
those
around
them
including
their
family
friends
and
even
their
solicitor
They
have
to
be
gently
reassured
that
their
life
isn
t
over
just
because
they
can
no
longer
do
the
things
they
used
to
do
As
they
come
to
accept
their
situation
a
new
optimism
and
drive
can
emerge
pushing
them
forward
to
achieve
far
more
than
they
thought
was
possible
But
it
s
during
the
darker
days
that
positive
reassurance
is
needed
to
convince
a
spinal
injury
victim
that
there
is
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
How
a
solicitor
can
help
Often
it
s
the
practical
things
that
can
make
a
difference
to
someone
coming
to
terms
with
a
spinal
injury
Mobility
in
particular
is
vitally
important
the
victim
needs
to
feel
that
they
are
not
completely
reliant
on
others
and
regaining
some
level
of
independence
can
be
crucial
to
recovery
If
your
solicitor
has
managed
to
secure
an
interim
payment
for
example
they
may
then
be
able
to
put
the
victim
in
touch
with
a
car
company
that
can
supply
the
victim
with
a
specially
adapted
vehicle
Something
as
simple
as
going
to
the
shops
or
being
able
to
move
around
their
own
home
without
help
can
mean
a
great
deal
to
a
previously
able
bodied
victim
of
a
spinal
injury

If
you
ve
had
an
accident
that
wasn
t
your
fault
then
once
the
medical
concerns
have
been
taken
care
of
it
is
often
a
matter
of
talking
to
an
injury
claims
solicitor
to
find
out
if
you
are
entitled
to
compensation
However
in
more
serious
cases
such
as
brain
injury
it
s
not
just
the
financial
concerns
that
take
precedence
A
serious
brain
injury
is
a
life
changing
event
Unlike
a
relatively
minor
injury
like
whiplash
a
brain
injury
can
mean
a
lifetime
of
care
and
a
complete
change
in
how
you
and
your
family
live
their
lives
So
in
cases
like
this
how
much
help
can
your
legal
team
provide
Not
just
financial
support
An
ordinary
solicitor
may
be
able
to
represent
your
interests
in
a
court
but
serious
injury
specialists
have
a
far
broader
spectrum
of
support
to
offer
Because
serious
injury
cases
such
as
brain
injury
compensation
claims
are
often
more
complex
in
nature
serious
injury
specialists
take
on
fewer
cases
than
ordinary
solicitors
This
means
that
they
get
to
know
each
individual
case
in
far
greater
depth
often
forming
a
close
personal
friendship
with
the
victim
and
family
themselves
This
does
not
colour
their
judgement
of
the
legal
process
but
instead
enables
them
to
better
understand
the
individual
circumstances
of
their
clients
and
their
specific
needs
Specialist
serious
injury
solicitors
can
also
help
in
more
practical
ways
too
Due
to
the
nature
of
their
business
they
can
call
on
the
expert
help
of
a
wide
range
of
medical
specialists
who
can
provide
both
expert
testimony
during
the
compensation
claim
process
and
also
specialist
medical
treatment
for
the
victim
In
head
injury
cases
the
experience
of
a
neurologist
familiar
with
trauma
injuries
for
example
can
make
a
huge
difference
to
the
long
term
treatment
path
that
s
taken
It
can
also
enable
the
victim
to
access
special
therapies
that
they
may
not
have
been
able
to
if
they
had
remained
with
the
usual
primary
care
providers

How
A
Truck
Accident
Lawyer
Can
Help
In
Highway
Accidents
Brain
injury
lawyers
Posted
by
It
is
seen
that
there
are
a
large
number
of
cases
on
the
highway
where
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
of
accidents
which
are
fatal
and
therefore
one
needs
to
have
some
good
legal
help
with
regards
to
legal
assistance
in
such
matters
In
this
relation
there
are
a
large
number
of
truck
accident
lawyer
who
specialize
in
dealing
in
cases
which
are
pertaining
to
road
side
accidents
and
therefore
they
cater
to
both
the
offenders
as
well
as
the
victims
It
is
pretty
easy
for
you
to
get
in
touch
with
them
and
you
just
need
to
look
them
up
on
the
classifieds
which
are
available
in
several
places
One
thing
that
one
needs
to
make
really
clear
is
that
they
understand
the
concept
of
how
and
what
are
the
reasons
of
highway
accidents
and
when
it
comes
to
the
damages
from
these
accidents
they
are
rather
big
in
terms
of
their
magnitude
and
therefore
one
needs
to
be
aware
of
how
to
handle
the
repercussions
of
the
same
The
truck
accident
lawyer
is
the
people
who
are
aware
of
the
stringent
laws
when
it
comes
to
the
regulations
which
are
imposed
in
the
highway
areas
This
is
rather
important
as
the
rules
are
a
great
factor
which
goes
onto
determining
how
a
case
can
be
handled
and
these
judges
are
indeed
specialists
in
this
regard
Furthermore
make
sure
that
these
lawyers
are
good
listeners
and
ensure
that
they
are
ready
to
give
you
the
support
not
only
in
the
court
but
also
outside
It
is
because
the
accidents
which
usually
happen
on
the
road
are
usually
of
a
grave
nature
and
more
often
than
not
end
up
in
huge
damages
for
the
people
who
are
involved
This
is
one
of
the
most
important
qualities
of
a
truck
accident
lawyer
which
determine
whether
you
should
at
all
appoint
them
or
not
Another
thing
that
is
really
important
in
this
case
is
whether
a
truck
accident
lawyer
is
capable
enough
to
handle
long
drawn
cases
It
is
because
legal
dealings
related
to
truck
accidents
and
highway
accidents
are
much
more
complicated
in
comparison
to
the
normal
laws
and
the
rules
that
are
there
on
the
city
roads
Another
thing
that
you
should
keep
in
mind
while
appointing
the
lawyer
is
that
they
should
be
from
a
particular
strategic
place
This
is
so
because
of
the
fact
that
the
high
court
accidents
are
usually
concerned
with
multiple
states
and
therefore
the
dealings
and
implications
of
the
cases
run
across
several
borders
This
means
that
the
lawyer
must
be
capable
of
handling
the
kind
of
pressures
that
are
involved
with
having
to
deal
with
such
complex
and
elaborate
cases
which
may
run
into
a
few
months
or
years
Along
with
that
the
cases
which
are
dealt
with
by
truck
accident
lawyer
are
involved
with
punishments
and
indemnities
that
are
far
larger
and
therefore
the
acumen
that
is
shown
by
such
lawyers
has
to
be
much
better
to
allow
you
to
get
your
end
of
the
deal
set
Therefore
we
see
that
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
you
need
to
know
when
it
comes
to
getting
a
good
truck
accident
lawyer

The
Benefits
of
Hiring
Personal
Injury
Lawyer
Brain
injury
lawyer
Posted
by
Accidents
and
injuries
never
knock
on
your
door
rather
they
knock
you
down
You
never
know
when
they
are
going
to
hit
you
and
most
of
the
times
you
have
nobody
else
to
blame
but
yourself
But
consider
a
situation
where
you
actually
fall
victim
to
an
accident
that
has
been
caused
by
the
careless
behavior
of
some
other
person
Will
you
manage
to
take
it
on
your
stride
or
would
you
rather
strike
back
Well
the
latter
is
certainly
a
better
option
and
you
could
go
right
ahead
and
claim
compensation
for
the
damages
Claiming
compensation
involves
a
lot
of
legal
complexities
and
that
is
why
you
would
have
to
seek
the
assistance
of
a
personal
injury
lawyer
There
are
a
lot
of
advantages
of
hiring
the
services
of
a
personal
injury
lawyer
and
some
of
them
have
been
discussed
below
A
personal
injury
lawyer
has
expertise
in
this
particular
field
They
have
a
lot
of
knowledge
regarding
the
subject
and
are
abreast
with
the
latest
changes
that
are
taking
place
in
the
law
The
personal
injury
lawyers
are
well
aware
of
the
various
loopholes
too
that
can
prove
to
be
of
use
for
their
clients
Some
people
think
that
hiring
the
services
of
these
professionals
is
nothing
but
wastage
of
precious
time
and
money
But
that
has
absolutely
no
resemblance
with
the
truth
Before
you
can
claim
for
the
damages
you
have
to
prove
it
in
the
court
of
the
law
that
the
accident
took
place
due
to
the
irresponsible
behavior
or
another
person
If
you
cannot
establish
it
you
will
not
be
allowed
to
sue
the
opponent
On
the
other
hand
if
you
appoint
a
personal
injury
lawyer
he
will
run
around
to
gather
the
required
evidence
and
also
manage
the
entire
paperwork
Thanks
to
his
expertise
he
will
be
able
to
tackle
tricky
court
room
situations
and
guide
your
case
smoothly
to
victory
Even
if
you
decide
to
settle
the
matter
out
of
court
your
attorney
will
make
sure
that
you
do
not
agree
for
an
amount
that
is
far
less
than
what
you
actually
deserve
He
will
calculate
the
amount
of
compensation
taking
into
account
your
medical
bills
as
well
as
the
loss
in
wages
due
to
absence
from
work
Before
hiring
a
personal
injury
lawyer
Clearwater
residents
have
to
check
if
the
professional
in
question
has
a
valid
license

Settle
your
own
personal
injury
claim
Posted
by
Birmingham
MI
Law
Firm
is
an
entity
formed
by
a
group
of
lawyers
The
entity
is
set
up
as
a
business
It
offers
legal
representation
to
persons
who
are
involved
in
a
legal
tussle
There
are
a
number
of
services
that
such
companies
offer
to
their
clients
The
business
informs
the
clients
of
their
responsibilities
and
rights
If
a
person
has
no
knowledge
about
the
legal
world
they
are
expected
to
hire
the
services
of
the
lawyer
to
work
for
them
However
these
are
not
the
only
services
that
they
are
known
to
offer
to
the
public
There
are
various
types
of
practices
in
the
legal
file
Some
people
operate
their
firms
alone
while
others
have
firms
that
employ
many
Birmingham
MI
lawyers
A
number
of
these
firms
have
opened
up
offices
in
more
than
one
location
When
a
person
opens
up
their
own
legal
company
they
only
deal
with
a
specific
type
of
law
This
is
different
from
the
service
offered
by
the
large
businesses
The
larger
entities
are
furnished
with
different
departments
that
oversee
the
diverse
areas
of
the
law
With
the
different
departments
they
are
able
to
open
up
their
services
to
more
than
one
type
of
client
There
is
a
rule
that
ensures
that
the
only
people
who
can
open
up
law
firms
are
lawyers
The
companies
are
prohibited
from
earning
incomes
from
alternative
sources
However
it
is
now
possible
for
the
company
to
have
some
of
partners
who
are
not
practitioners
of
law
The
reason
why
the
rule
was
put
in
place
was
to
ensure
objectivity
on
the
part
of
the
lawyers
Lawyers
are
expected
to
represent
their
clients
with
all
that
they
have
without
overcharging
them
The
officer
of
the
court
is
never
expected
to
come
up
with
bad
defenses
If
a
lawyer
is
a
shareholder
in
any
company
they
will
be
tempted
to
make
legal
decisions
that
will
be
in
favor
of
the
company
they
are
affiliated

What
to
look
for
in
a
solicitor
when
making
a
brain
injury
claim
Best
personal
injury
attorney
Posted
by
Suffering
a
brain
or
severe
head
injury
can
be
a
traumatic
experience
of
life
changing
proportions
It
is
something
that
can
leave
its
sufferers
without
much
hope
lead
them
down
a
road
of
anger
depression
and
bitterness
and
in
need
of
constant
round
the
clock
care
in
some
cases
However
no
matter
how
monumental
a
brain
injury
does
not
mark
the
end
of
one
s
life
There
are
options
that
are
open
to
those
individuals
that
have
suffered
a
brain
injury
One
of
these
opportunities
is
to
make
a
claim
for
compensation
providing
the
injury
was
suffered
as
a
result
of
someone
else
s
negligence
When
making
the
claim
it
would
probably
be
advised
because
of
the
nature
of
the
injury
to
call
on
the
services
of
a
specialist
solicitor
A
brain
injury
claim
can
be
quite
complex
in
their
nature
and
it
is
better
to
be
represented
by
someone
who
is
an
expert
in
the
field
rather
than
a
complete
novice
The
first
question
that
should
be
asked
determines
exactly
that
have
they
undertaken
any
previous
brain
injury
work
and
how
many
cases
they
are
currently
handling
As
mentioned
previously
a
solicitor
with
a
lower
number
of
current
cases
could
be
better
for
those
with
a
more
complex
case
If
the
solicitor
hasn
t
undertaken
any
cases
in
the
field
of
brain
injuries
then
it
probably
isn
t
worth
considering
In
their
line
of
business
they
take
on
far
fewer
cases
than
that
of
a
standard
solicitor
This
allows
for
the
solicitor
to
familiarise
themselves
with
each
case
and
allows
for
the
solicitor
to
understand
the
needs
of
the
client
When
looking
for
a
solicitor
to
represent
a
case
for
a
claim
it
is
important
to
consider
whether
the
solicitor
is
accredited
by
Headway
the
brain
injury
association
If
they
are
the
chances
are
they
will
have
a
high
level
of
knowledge
when
it
comes
to
brain
injuries
Like
belonging
in
Law
Society
s
Personal
Injury
Panel
or
the
Association
of
Personal
injury
lawyers
APIL
having
these
kind
of
credential
can
give
a
good
indication
of
the
kind
of
specialist
interest
that
a
solicitor
has
There
must
be
some
kind
of
comfortable
knowledge
of
how
a
case
for
a
brain
injury
claim
would
be
funded
beforehand
which
can
be
done
simply
by
reading
up
on
the
subject
A
good
confident
level
will
probably
help
determine
what
type
of
legal
aid
is
needed

If
you
live
in
Atlanta
GA
and
you
have
been
the
victim
of
an
accident
that
caused
serious
injury
or
financial
hardship
Scott
Monge
can
offer
you
legal
counsel
and
excellent
legal
representation
Even
if
your
injury
was
not
the
result
of
trauma
but
rather
the
result
of
toxic
chemicals
or
repetitive
motion
stress
on
your
body
such
as
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
Scott
Monge
can
help
you
to
recover
your
losses
from
decreased
productivity
decreased
overall
health
and
a
decreased
standard
of
living
Slip
and
Fall
accidents
and
premise
liability
injuries
are
unfortunately
common
However
the
burden
they
place
on
the
people
who
suffer
from
them
and
on
their
families
can
sometimes
be
unbearable
An
improperly
maintained
stairway
can
result
in
a
fall
that
leads
to
brain
injury
A
landlord
s
negligence
can
lead
to
lead
poisoning
or
lung
infections
from
dangerous
mold
A
company
s
refusal
to
buy
ergonomic
equipment
can
lead
to
permanently
damaged
ligaments
in
the
arm
These
serious
personal
injuries
affect
victims
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
and
have
ripple
effects
on
their
spouses
and
children
A
victim
of
catastrophic
injury
such
as
those
who
sustained
head
trauma
or
an
amputation
must
be
cared
for
by
a
family
member
and
various
medical
practitioners
over
the
long
haul
The
medical
costs
associated
with
catastrophic
injuries
can
lead
to
bankruptcy
The
most
devastating
personal
injuries
are
cases
of
wrongful
death
Families
must
somehow
cope
with
the
grief
from
losing
a
loved
one
while
at
the
same
time
manage
an
incredible
level
of
anger
against
those
responsible
Trying
to
get
justice
can
be
a
frustrating
undertaking
for
many
of
these
families
because
those
responsible
know
exactly
what
is
at
stake
They
give
families
the
run
around
they
cover
up
they
deny
they
threaten
they
doctor
up
records
they
restrict
records
they
condescend
to
the
family
they
blame

Canadians
who
have
completed
their
sentences
after
having
been
convicted
of
a
criminal
offense
can
apply
for
a
pardon
provided
they
have
demonstrated
they
have
been
law
abiding
citizens
ever
since
In
special
circumstances
the
Governor
General
can
also
grant
clemency
if
there
is
new
evidence
of
innocence
or
other
reason
to
remove
records
or
sentences
It
s
normal
to
hear
declarations
of
protest
from
anyone
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime
The
old
joke
is
that
the
prisons
are
full
of
innocent
people
Unfortunately
there
have
been
many
wrongful
convictions
over
the
years
due
to
bad
evidence
or
over
zealous
police
looking
for
somebody
to
arrest
Before
the
advent
of
DNA
evidence
there
was
no
sure
fire
way
to
eliminate
suspects
based
on
unimpeachable
scientific
analysis
of
hair
bodily
fluids
and
skin
cells
Many
innocent
people
were
executed
over
the
years
and
it
was
considered
simply
the
sad
cost
of
doing
business
in
the
justice
system
This
article
discusses
some
of
the
high
profile
Canadian
cases
and
offers
insight
into
some
of
the
safeguards
to
exonerate
those
who
have
been
wrongly
convicted
Perhaps
the
most
shocking
trial
was
that
of
Steven
Truscott
in
1959
He
was
tried
as
an
adult
convicted
and
sentenced
to
hang
at
the
age
of
14
for
the
rape
murder
of
12
year
old
classmate
Lynne
Harper
His
death
sentence
was
commuted
to
life
imprisonment
after
four
months
on
death
row
facing
the
gallows
and
he
was
paroled
in
1969
after
considerable
public
outcry
over
the
circumstantial
case
His
conviction
was
later
deemed
a
miscarriage
of
justice
and
he
received
6
5
million
in
compensation
in
2008
Donald
Marshall
Jr
of
Sydney
Nova
Scotia
was
17
years
old
he
received
a
life
sentence
for
the
murder
of
his
friend
Sandy
Seale
He
was
released
after
10
years
when
someone
else
confessed
to
the
crime
Fortunately
for
many
wrongfully
convicted
murder
suspects
the
death
sentence
has
not
existed
in
Canada
for
many
years
One
can
only
imagine
how
many
innocent
people
were
hanged
in
those
days
before
the
truth
could
come
out
using
modern
forensic
evidence
David
Milgaard
Guy
Paul
Morin
William
Mullins
Johnson
James
Driskell
and
Thomas
Sophonow
were
other
convicted
murderers
proven
later
to
be
innocent
and
given
millions
in
government
compensation
to
make
up
for
decades
spent
behind
bars
Some
were
acquitted
upon
appeal
and
others
were
granted
special
clemency
by
the
Governor
General
representing
the
Canadian
Cabinet
Regular
Canadian
pardons
are
granted
after
a
waiting
period
and
a
successful
application
by
a
person
who
has
served
all
the
conditions
of
a
conviction
such
as
a
jail
sentence
fine
and
probation
The
waiting
period
for
indictable
offences
is
currently
five
years
and
may
be
increased
to
ten
years
if
and
when
Bill
C
23
is
passed

tips
when
making
a
brain
injury
claim
Posted
by
Brain
injuries
are
undeniably
multi
faceted
The
aftermath
that
follows
having
suffered
one
can
leave
there
victims
in
a
state
of
bewilderment
and
anger
The
prime
focus
of
family
members
and
loved
ones
of
the
victim
is
usually
and
rightly
so
placed
on
providing
care
and
support
to
allow
the
victim
to
make
a
successful
recovery
In
the
majority
of
cases
this
will
leave
any
notion
of
making
a
brain
injury
claim
as
a
mere
afterthought
However
the
possibility
of
a
brain
injury
claim
is
something
that
should
not
be
viewed
with
disdain
A
successful
brain
injury
compensation
claim
could
result
in
a
good
amount
of
financial
compensation
This
compensation
could
then
be
put
towards
medical
bills
and
improving
the
quality
of
life
that
the
victim
experiences
It
may
seem
daunting
to
make
a
brain
injury
claim
partly
as
it
may
act
in
invoking
some
kind
of
closure
and
a
sense
of
moving
on
With
this
in
mind
we
have
created
some
top
tips
to
take
into
account
when
making
a
brain
injury
claim
1
Seek
a
specialist
As
has
already
been
established
brain
injuries
cases
differ
an
unbelievable
amount
between
each
case
Therefore
a
brain
injury
claim
requires
the
attention
of
a
brain
injury
solicitor
only
a
brain
injury
solicitor
will
do
Employing
a
standard
solicitor
will
severely
risk
the
chances
of
receiving
brain
injury
compensation
from
a
claim
This
is
purely
down
to
their
lack
of
knowledge
surrounding
brain
injuries
While
they
will
undoubtedly
possess
a
legal
nous
it
is
almost
certain
that
there
medical
knowledge
will
be
limited
if
not
nonexistent

When

Contact
an
Atlanta
Car
Accident
Attorney
Following
a
Collision
Posted
by
Whenever
people
are
involved
in
an
auto
accident
their
first
concern
is
on
their
physical
and
psychological
wellbeing
as
well
as
the
safety
of
their
passengers
and
anyone
else
involved
in
the
crash
and
rightfully
so
After
the
shock
of
the
accident
has
worn
off
people
s
thoughts
turn
to
their
damaged
cars
their
car
as
well
as

Many

accident
However
when
it
comes
to
hiring
a
personal

s
why
Statute
of
limitations
Perhaps
the
most
important
reason

of
limitations
when
it

legal
action
following
a
car
crash
Each
state
has
different
time
limits
that
they

the
best
way
to
ensure
you
are
within
these
parameters
no
matter
where
you
live
Know
your
rights
The
best
way
for
accident
victims
to
learn
their
rights
is
through
the
counsel
of
an
experienced
Atlanta
car
accident
attorney
These

Attacked
in
the
parking
lot
Who
is
Liable
Posted
by
If
you
live
in
a
big
city
it
is
likely
that
there
is
a
somewhat
high
rate
of
crime
Obviously
there
is
crime
in
every
city
but
it
is
much
more
common
to
be
assaulted
in
some
way
when
you
live
in
a
big
city
When
you
are
attacked
it
can
be
confusing
and
hard
to
know
what
you
should
do
next
It
is
important
that
you
follow
a
few
suggestions
so
that
you
are
not
stuck
with
the
medical
bills
and
loss
of
property
that
you
suffer
from
the
attack
One
of
the
first
things
that
you
will
want
to
do
after
you
have
been
attacked
in
a
parking
lot
is
to
contact
the
police
If
possible
you
will
want
to
contact
the
police
immediately
after
the
incident
occurs
The
police
will
likely
come
out
to
the
crime
scene
to
do
an
investigation
of
what
happened
and
create
a
police
report
It
is
essential
that
you
get
a
police
report
filed
so
that
you
have
something
other
than
your
own
word
if
you
have
to
go
to
court
The
police
report
will
likely
include
statements
from
witnesses
that
were
present
at
the
time
of
the
incident
and
any
other
details
that
need
to
be
noted
You
will
want
to
make
sure
that
you
make
the
police
put
in
the
report
details
about
the
scene
Were
there
lights
in
the
parking
lot
that
were
burned
out
Did
the
security
cameras
on
the
lot
pick
up
anything
unusual
Details
like
this
can
be
very
important
in
a
court
case
to
determine
liability
and
who
is
ultimately
going
to
pay
for
your
lost
possessions
or
injuries
The
next
person
that
you
will
want
to
contact
is
a
doctor
This
is
very
important
especially
if
you
sustained
injuries
during
the
attack
Have
the
doctor
look
over
the
areas
that
were
affected
and
make
sure
they
write
down
anything
that
is
unusual
These
details
are
some
of
the
most
important
because
they
may
play
a
part
in
how
much
money
you
are
entitled
to
After
you
visit
a
physician
to
look
at
your
injuries
you
will
want
to
speak
with
a
lawyer
Hiring
an
El
Paso
personal
injury
attorney
may
be
the
most
important
step
of
the
process
as
he
or
she
will
be
able
to
walk
you
through
the
legal
process
and
help
you
get
the
money
you
deserve
There
are
a
variety
of
people
that
may
be
liable
to
pay
for
your
injuries
depending
on
the
situation
and
what
happened
so
it
is
important
to
sit
down
with
your
lawyer
and
find
out
what
options
you
have
If
there
were
insufficient
security
measures
in
the
parking
lot
at
the
time
you
were
attacked
the
lot
s
owners
may
be
liable
for
some
or
all
of
your
property
loss
and
or
medical
expenses

What
happens
during
an
accident
claim
Posted
by
Accident
claim
a
process
not
short
of
any
publicising
but
at
the
same
time
one
that
not
everyone
has
a
full
understanding
of
Many
people
will
be
well
aware
of
the
circumstances
that
make
an
accident
eligible
for
an
accident
claim
What
they
may
be
less
aware
of
is
what
happen
during
an
accident
claim
To
recap
an
accident
claim
can
be
lodged
if
a
victim
has
sustained
their
personal
injury
because
of
the
negligence
or
lack
of
care
displayed
by
another
party
If
successful
the
claimant
could
be
in
line
to
receive
compensation
and
extra
payment
to
cover
loss
of
earnings
medical
costs
and
the
like
Those
who
are
unsure
of
whether
their
accident
claim
could
warrant
financial
compensation
would
be
well
advised
to
consult
a
serious
injury
law
firm
Serious
injury
law
firms
for
the
most
part
employ
accident
claims
solicitors
of
the
highest
quality
therefore
they
will
be
able
to
utilise
their
own
experience
to
determine
whether
a
claimant
s
case
is
eligible
Once
conclusive
on
whether
making
an
accident
claim
is
the
right
course
of
action
to
take
the
case
is
then
passed
onto
an
accident
claims
solicitor
Using
a
wealth
of
knowledge
and
expertise
the
solicitor
will
brief
the
client
on
the
claims
process
providing
reassurance
and
advice
Amongst
the
many
things
that
many
serious
injury
law
firms
will
provide
are
dedicated
case
managers
The
kind
of
issues
that
these
dedicated
case
managers
will
offer
includes
Dedicated
one
on
one
management
consultations
on
the
actual
case
A
full
assessment
of
the
injured
party
s
needs
An
identification
of
the
people
important
to
delivering
any
needed
services
that
may
be
required
An
on
going
review
and
reassessment
of
any
suggestions
during
the
case
It
is
important
that
if
making
a
claim
it
is
done
soon
after
the
actual
injury
has
been
sustained
This
improves
the
likelihood
of
the
case
being
successful
because
of
the
availability
of
both
evidence
and
witnesses
to
substantiate
a
claim
The
longer
a
claim
is
stalled
upon
the
harder
it
is
to
call
on
possible
witnesses
and
evidence
that
could
be
crucial
in
helping
to
decide
a
case

What
are
some
of
the
things
you
need
to
look
for
when
choosing
an
attorney
to
represent
your
interest
in
case
of
an
accident
If
history
is
anything
to
go
by
we
all
know
that
over
the
past
decades
victims
of
accidents
i
e
construction
accidents
car
accidents
18
wheeler
accidents
and
slip
and
fall
accidents
have
been
handsomely
rewarded
for
their
injuries
This
has
led
to
an
upsurge
of
ambulance
chaser
attorneys
whose
main
aim
is
to
get
rich
quick
from
your
settlement
awards
Therefore
when
choosing
Las
Vegas
accident
attorney
it
is
important
that
you
take
certain
factors
into
consideration
to
ensure
the
person
representing
you
has
your
interest
at
heart
Having
recognized
the
challenges
that
accidents
victims

guidelines
on
how
to
make
an
informed
decision
when

Tips
and

Charges
There
are
millions
of
accident
victims
who
suffer
in
silence
given
that
they
cannot
afford
legal
fees
Unknown
to
them
that
a
majority
of
Las
Vegas
accident
attorney
uses
what
is
known
as
contingency
fee
This
is
whereby
the
attorney
gets
his
pay
after
the
settlement
has
been
awarded
by
deducting
a
certain
percentage
from
the
final
amount
However
other
expenses
i
e
hiring
expert
witnesses
are
met
by
the
client
Furthermore
there
are
free
legal
aid
clinics
that
will
readily
take
up
a
case
if
you
prove
you
cannot
afford
an
attorney
Therefore
before
giving
up
make
sure
that
you
have
checked
how
the
law
firm
you
are
about
to
hire
charges
Reference
Getting
a
good
Las
Vegas
accident
attorney
to
represent
your
interest
will
hinge
on
the
reference
that
you
use
In
case
you
do
not
know
an
attorney
in
person
then
the
best
reference
to
utilize
is
the
American
Bar
Association

Treating
Knee
Pains
Posted
by
Everyone
can
experience
knee
pains
This
is
a
problem
because
it
can
cause
a
delay
to
our
daily
chores
And
there
s
more
problem
with
this
because
a
lot
of
people
do
not
know
how
to
treat
knee
pains
This
issue
has
been
most
discussed
after
Zimmer
s
knee
replacement
system
got
a
high
failure
rate
What
causes
knee
pains
Knee
pains
can
be
a
result
of
different
reasons
but
its
direct
cause
is
our
tendonitis
Now
what
can
we
do
in
order
to
get
away
from
this
pain
Actually
we
can
do
something
about
this
even
if
we
are
just
inside
our
homes
Of
course
a
doctor
s
advice
is
important
but
right
ways
have
already
been
established
in
terms
of
treating
this
kind
of
dilemma
Now
here
s
what
you
need
to
do
First
you
have
to
understand
why
your
knee
is
in
pain
An
inflammation
is
actually
the
one
causing
us
pain
Where
is
this
inflammation
coming
from
It
is
the
patella
tendon
also
called
knee
tendon
Now
here
s
what
you
have
to
do
in
order
to
relieve
this
pain
coming
from
the
inflammation
of
the
knee
tendon
On
your
lower
knee
try
putting
an
ice
pack
Please
never
use
an
ice
directly
on
your
skin
If
you
do
not
have
an
ice
pack
you
can
use
ice
but
cover
it
with
a
towel
In
order
to
help
you
get
away
from
this
knee
pain
you
can
do
strectching
With
your
legs
straight
out
in
front
of
you
you
can
reach
for
them
with
your
two
hands
Do
this
for
ten
seconds
and
repeat
for
a
few
times
Furthermore
in
order
to
avoid
this
in
future
situations
stop
doing
certain
activities
that
can
damage
your
knees
Leg
squatting
and
leg
extension
exercises
should
be
avoided
Remember
that
you
have
to
be
careful
every
time
you
are
using
the
stairs
Hold
on
to
the
railings
If
it
is
available
just
use
the
elevator
Taking
care
of
our
knees
is
very
important
especially
when
it
is
in
pain
This
just
show
how
important
our
knees
are
because
our
knees
are
essential
in
taking
us
places
We
can
link
this
idea
as
to
why
people
kept
on
fighting
for
a
zimmer
knee
recall
to
happen
In
this
area
one
way
of
helping
is
to
file
for
a
lawsuit
if
you
are
one
of
those
people
who
have
been
installed
with
the
Zimmer
Cr
flex
knee
device
If
more
and
more
affected
people
file
for
a
lawsuit
the
public
and
the
right
agencies
will
be
notified
and
a
recall
will
be
put
into
action
So
if
you
have
been
affected

a
lawyer
today

situation
can
be

still
could
not
conceive
of
a
scenario
where
they
are
incapacitated
and

result
their

to
earn
is
lost
or
left
bare
minimum

Disability

foreclose
their

individual

he
has
met

an
accident
and
though

life
but
not

abilities
His
intension
to
pay
would
be
still
there
but
ability
to
pay
would
be
missing
Your
non

pay

t
hold
any

Pharmaceutical

Posted

The
connection
between
Yasmin
and
Yaz
birth
control
and
serious
medical
implications
such
as
heart
attack
stroke
blood
clots
bladder
problems
and
even
death
has
often
been
overlooked
by
patients
family
and
doctors
As
Yasmin
and
Yaz
birth
control
lawsuits
mount
doctors
are
beginning
to
pay
more
attention
to
the
possible
connection
as
patients
are
demanding
action
If
you
feel
that
you
or
someone
you
love
has
experienced
a
negative
side
effect
that
resulted
from
the
use
of
Yasmin
or
Yaz
birth
control
it
is
important
to
speak
with
your
doctor
and
then
consult
with
a
pharmaceutical
malpractice
attorney
The
basis
for
birth
control
lawsuits
related
to
Yaz
is
that
the
maker
of
Yaz
Bayer
Corporation
conducted
ad
campaigns
that
claimed
the
Yaz
birth
control
pill
had
a
wide
range
of
uses
in
addition
to
being
a
birth
control
method
The
ad
campaign
claimed
the
medication
could
help
alleviate
such
things
as
acne
mood
swings
and
other
conditions
associated
with
menstruation
The
ads
also
claimed
that
there
were
minimal
side
effects
The
FDA
found
this
to
be
misleading
advertising
and
that
they
overstated
the
effectiveness
of
the
birth
control
pill
It
is
reported
that
Bayer
paid
around
20
million
dollars
to
correct
the
misrepresentations
The
FDA
claimed
that
Bayer
had
overstated
the
benefits
of
Yaz
and
downplayed
its
risks
More
recent
bad
news
for
Bayer
is
that
according
to
a
recent
study
in
the
British
Medical
Journal
Yaz
is
three
times
more
likely
to
cause
fatal
blood
clots
than
older
contraceptives
Ask
a
pharmaceutical
malpractice
attorney
for
advice
on
how
to
properly
pursue
a
course
of
action
if
you
have
experienced
any
of
these
negative
side
effects
as
a
result
of
using
Yasmin
and
Yaz
birth
control
In
the
rare
event
that
a
patient
taking
the
birth
pill
control
suffers
complications
that
lead
to
death
the
family
can
pursue
a
wrongful
death
or
malpractice
suit
against
those
responsible
Malpractice
suits
are
those
in
which
the
professionals
or
corporations
at
hand
have
been
negligent
in
providing
the
expected
level
of
care
that
the
patients
and
families
expect
The
medical
field
is
where
most
malpractice
claims
occur
including
suits
brought
against
pharmaceutical
giants
In
summary
Yasmin
and
Yaz
birth
control
have
been
the
subject
of
multiple
federal
lawsuits
against
the
Bayer
Corporation
and
the
suits
allege
that
the
company
failed
to
warn
women
and
their
medical
providers
of
the
increased
risk
of
injury
associated
with
the
pills
Compensation
may
be
due
if
you
have
been
harmed
by
negative
side
effects
of
this
drug
Compensation
can
be
in
the
form
of
repayment
of
medical
costs
that
have
been
incurred
the
cost
of
rehabilitation
services
and
loss
of
income
both
past
and
future
If
the
patient
suffering
from
side
effects
has
died
as
a
result
the
family
may
be
able
to
sue
for
compensation
in
the
form
of
lost
wages
and
funeral
expenses

Staying
Positive
During
a
Spinal
Injury
Claim
Posted
by
The
implications
that
a
spinal
injury
has
on
its
victim
are
extremely
severe
They
can
hit
the
victim
both
physically
and
emotionally
Some
of
the
most
serious
spinal
injuries
can
also
lead
to
lengthy
spells
of
rehabilitation
required
to
deal
with
the
often
alien
circumstances
Though
undoubtedly
difficult
this
should
be
no
reason
to
be
negative
A
successful
spinal
injury
claim
could
prove
to
be
the
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
Though
in
the
case
of
many
spinal
injuries
which
see
leave
the
victim
without
the
most
basic
bodily
functions
that
most
take
for
granted
financial
compensation
from
a
spinal
injury
claim
may
seem
scant
Financial
compensation
from
a
successful
spinal
injury
claim
could
be
put
towards
improving
the
quality
of
life
experienced
by
the
victim
of
a
spinal
injury
The
shortfalls
inevitably
caused
by
having
to
re
adjust
to
a
new
situation
could
in
effect
be
covered
by
compensation
this
could
remove
the
pressure
and
strain
brought
about
by
a
spinal
injury
The
first
thing
to
do
for
this
type
of
accident
claim
is
to
seek
out
a
specialist
spinal
injury
solicitor
Finding
a
specialist
in
the
area
of
spinal
injury
claims
can
be
difficult
However
it
is
important
to
note
that
a
good
spinal
injury
solicitor
will
be
an
asset
when
making
an
accident
claim
As
already
established
it
can
be
difficult
to
find
a
good
specialist
capable
of
taking
on
a
spinal
injury
claim
case
They
aren
t
impossible
to
find
though
A
good
amount
of
research
into
serious
injury
law
firms
and
the
services
they
offer
will
usually
be
enough
to
find
a
good
spinal
injury
solicitor
No
matter
how
difficult
the
search
to
find
a
specialist
capable
of
dealing
with
a
spinal
injury
claim
becomes
it
is
imperative
that
you
seek
the
services
of
a
professional
Standard
solicitors
just
aren
t
experienced
in
dealing
with
the
complex
issues
that
surround
spinal
injuries
claims
hence
the
specialist
tag
Employing
a
standard
solicitor
for
a
spinal
injury
claim
would
be
an
extremely
careless
thing
to
do
and
could
seriously
damage
the
chances
of
the
case
being
successful

case
can
often
be
detailed
and
your
solicitor
should
take
you
through
all
the
steps
required
to
make
a
brain
injury
claim
The
first
appointment
with
your
solicitor
can
include
close
supportive
family
members
and
should
go
through
everything
that
you
need
to
know
Your
solicitor
should
be
aware
of
your
rights
and
should
be
highly
experienced
in
brain
injury
claims
You
and
your
family
members
should
be
prepared
with
all
the
questions
that
you
need
to
ask
Your
solicitor
will
require
a
medical
report
so
that
they
can
fully
assess
the
situation
Very
often
your
solicitor
will
look
at
your
specific
injuries
and
what
impact
it
will
have
on
the
rest
of
your
life
Not
only
will
physical
injuries
be
taken
into
consideration
but
the
mental
and
emotional
impact
that
your
injuries
have
had
as
well
as
how
much
work
you
lost
as
a
direct
result
Very
often
in
brain
injury
cases
your
solicitor
deducts
none
of
the
compensation
awarded
the
insurance
company
will
often
cover
their
costs
You
will
not
lose
out
financially
in
your
claim
what
so
ever
providing
that
you
work
with
a
trusted
and
experienced
solicitor
All
claims
are
completely
different
so
it
is
hard
to
determine
a
set
amount
of
compensation
for
your
case
In
serious
cases
that
have
resulted
in
lifetime
care
claimants
are
said
to
have
been
awarded
as
much
as
1
million
There
are
some
very
rough
guidelines
that
can
be
followed
with
regards
to
payouts
in
brain
injury
compensation

Why
you
should
make
a
personal
injury
claim
following
an
accident
that
was
not
your
fault
Posted
by
If
you
have
had
an
accident
that
wasn
t
your
fault
you
may
be
entitled
to
compensation
Don
t
ignore
your
accident
making
an
accident
claim
means
you
could
receive
what
you
deserve
compensation
for
your
injuries
Personal
claims
are
not
only
related
to
physical
injuries
a
claimant
can
ask
for
compensation
for
emotional
and
mental
injuries
alike
In
serious
cases
claimants
are
often
left
with
injuries
that
have
since
had
an
impact
on
their
every
day
life
This
is
not
however
always
the
case
and
many
claims
made
have
led
to
full
recoveries
Claiming
for
compensation
does
not
have
to
be
stressful
or
difficult
The
first
step
to
making
an
accident
claim
is
to
make
sure
that
you
have
sought
medical
advice
and
made
yourself
aware
of
your
entitlements
by
union
organisations
Seeking
professional
advice
will
leave
you
in
good
stead
It
will
help
you
to
seek
the
right
injury
solicitor
and
leave
you
knowing
what
you
are
entitled
to
and
how
best
to
explain
your
claim
Make
sure
that
you
have
as
much
evidence
as
possible
including
names
dates
and
even
photographic
evidence
all
this
will
go
towards
supporting
your
case
and
putting
you
in
a
stronger
position
In
a
road
traffic
accident
for
example
you
must
have
reported
your
claim
to
the
police
Many
law
firms
have
their
own
website
so
doing
your
research
beforehand
means
that
you
can
look
at
their
case
studies
and
history
A
firm
that
is
open
and
honest
about
previous
cases
they
have
handled
will
make
you
feel
secure
in
their
hands
Choosing
the
right
solicitor
is
vital
in
a
personal
injury
case
The
right
solicitor
will
have
previous
accident
claim
experience
and
will
know
how
best
to
put
your
case
together

You
may
be
entitled
to
compensation
if
you
have
had
an
accident
that
wasn
t
your
fault
Each
year
companies
and
individuals
pay
out
compensation
to
those

on
the

at
home
at

were
not
your
fault
you
can
seek
the
advice
of
a
solicitor
to
put
together
your
case
Each
claim
is
unique
and
the
payout
depends
entirely
on
the
situation
and
the
injuries
incurred
No
two
accident
claims
are
ever
the
same
as
small
factors
can
change
each
individual
situation
Cases
in
which
the
payout
reaches
a
substantial
sum
often
make
it
to
the
media
These
often
involve
injuries
that
have
caused
the
claimant
life
long
suffering
mentally
physically
or
emotionally
Often
the
claimants
are
affected
in
their
every
day
lives
as
a
result
These
are
just
some
examples
of
large
payouts
as
a
result
of
serious
accident
claims

was
left
with
cerebral
palsy
which
is
said
to
be
caused
by
the

injury
he
incurred
just
after
his
birth
The
cerebral
palsy
was
a
direct
result
of
his
brain
injuries
Similar
brain
injury
cases
are
said
to
have
won
more
than
1
million
in
compensation
A
medical
researcher
who
suffered
brain
damage
after
waiting
almost

Can
I
claim
for
a
personal
injury
when
I
ve
suffered
a
burn
Posted
by
Burns
can
cause
damage
to
skin
that
lasts
a
lifetime
Unfortunately
burns
are
quite
common
with
over
150
000
cases
of
accident
and
emergency
visits
each
year
Burns
can
be
down
to
the
negligence
of
someone
else
and
in
this
case
you
can
make
a
personal
injury
claim
especially
as
burns
are
so
severe
That
is
why
if
you
have
suffered
a
burn
you
can
claim
for
a
personal
injury
Burn
injuries
commonly
happen
in
the
workplace
These
common
accidents
include
poorly
wired
electrics
businesses
have
a
responsibility
to
have
offices
correctly
wired
workplace
fires
need
clear
hazard
signs
hot
machinery
that
should
also
come
with
a
warning
radiation
handling
of
hot
liquids
and
objects
inhalation
of
toxic
fumes
need
protective
headwear
and
clothing
to
prevent
this
There
are
also
three
main
types
of
burn
Superficial
burns
are
red
but
only
hit
the
skins
surface
Partial
thickness
burns
go
in
deeper
and
are
more
damaging
to
your
skin
These
will
dry
red
and
eventually
go
blotchy
Full
thickness
burns
occur
when
all
skin
layers
are
burned
This
affected
area
will
turn
a
different
colour
It
is
best
if
these
burns
have
occurred
though
the
fault
of
someone
else
or
which
could
have
been
prevented
if
correct
safety
procedures
had
been
introduced
to
consult
a
personal
injury
lawyer
who
specialises
in
injuries
as
a
result
of
negligence
or
burn
injuries
in
general
Personal
injury
lawyers
expect
you
to
provide
evidence
of
the
injury
such
as
medical
reports
and
x
rays
and
pictures
of
the
burn
as
well
as
proof
the
other
party
was
responsible
The
injury
lawyer
will
try
their
best
to
get
your
claim
to
court
and
win
compensation
for
you
especially
if
it
has
affected
your
life
They
will
make
sure
the
company
or
person
responsible
was
wrong
under
law
and
that
caused
your
personal
injury
Burn
cases
tend
to
be
no
win
no
fee
So
if
you
win
the
personal
injury
claim
you
will
receive
compensation
for
injuries
suffered
future
treatment
you
may
need
in
the
future
loss
of
earnings
or
loss
of
job
medical
bills
as
well
as
emotional
trauma
and
family
care
All
this
depends
on
the
severity
of
the
burn
injury
Employers
are
obliged
by
law
to
ensure
safe
working
conditions
and
it
is
this
key
factor
your
personal
injury
lawyer
can
emphasise
to
win
the
case
Also
common
is
what
is
known
as
an
internal
burn
These
are
through
airways
and
lungs
and
symptoms
include
sore
throat
burnt
tongues
as
a
result
of
eating
hot
foods
wheezing
inhaling
soot
or
fumes
Again
you
can
file
a
personal
injury
claim
if
these
are
the
result
of
negligence
The
company
you
work
for
may
have
an
environment
where
you
are
inhaling
fumes
or
your
skin
may
burn
if
exposed
to
radiation
You
can
claim
for
a
personal
injury
when
you
have
suffered
a
burn
but
only
if
it
is
the
fault
of
someone
else
If
you
were
not
alerted
of
workplace
hazards
subjected
to
an
environment
that
caused
skin
injuries
had
toxic
chemicals
spilt
on
you
or
been
in
a
workplace
fire
that
was
caused
by
the
company
then
you
can
lodge
a
claim
The
best
way
to
progress
forward
from
here
would
be
hiring
a
personal
injury
lawyer
who
will
try
to
make
sure
you
get
100
of
the
compensation
and
any
extra
add
ons
This
is
why
it
is
important
to
establish
whether
or
not
you
can
make
a
claim
because
if
it
was
your
own
fault
or
an
unpreventable
accident
it
will
be
more
difficult
to
make
a
personal
injury
claim
for
a
burn
injury

Were
you
injured
as
a
pedestrian
Posted
by
These
days
Britain
s
roads
are
busier
than
ever
before
with
over
30
million
cars
on
the
road
Inevitably
this
has
led
to
a
rise
in
pedestrian
accidents
Over
25
000
people
are
injured
every
year
on
Britain
s
roads
The
pedestrian
crossing
is
the
most
common
place
for
injury
on
the
roads
There
are
more
accidents
when
a
car
is
doing
a
speed
of
30mph
or
less
but
this
leads
to
less
serious
injuries
but
more
claims
for
personal
injury
compensation
Indeed
children
are
more
likely
to
be
involved
in
pedestrian
accidents
as
they
are
less
likely
to
know
much
about
traffic
and
run
into
roads
The
driver
should
be
aware
of
pedestrians
walking
on
pavements
and
standing
at
pedestrian
crossings
especially
during
traffic
light
changes
If
you
are
a
pedestrian
and
can
sufficiently
prove
that
you
were
not
responsible
for
the
injury
then
you
have
a
good
case
for
claiming
compensation
You
need
to
establish
the
scale
of
your
injuries
first
and
determine
that
your
injuries
were
not
the
result
of
you
walking
in
front
of
a
car
Make
sure
you
were
not
walking
in
the
road
as
any
hopes
of
getting
compensation
would
be
dashed
if
the
driver
can
prove
this
When
this
has
been
established
you
should
visit
a
Doctor
even
as
a
precautionary
measure
You
will
need
to
record
all
your
visits
to
the
Doctor
and
anything
else
that
relates
to
the
accident
The
more
proof
of
the
scale
of
the
injury
this
shows
the
more
compensation
you
will
receive
Therefore
it
is
best
to
file
a
claim
as
quickly
as
possible
and
you
will
need
to
contact
a
personal
injury
lawyer
who
specialises
in
this
area
Personal
injury
lawyers
can
greatly
strengthen
your
case
for
compensation
The
Personal
injury
lawyer
will
develop
a
case
with
strong
arguments
which
is
why
it
is
important
to
have
documents
such
as
Hospital
visits
and
medical
bills
The
personal
injury
claim
will
then
be
established
and
the
personal
injury
lawyer
may
bring
in
eyewitnesses
which
can
greatly
enhance
your
case
The
personal
injury
lawyer
therefore
is
integral
if
you
feel
you
are
entitled
to
compensation
for
an
accident
as
a
pedestrian
that
was
not
your
fault
Pedestrian
injuries
are
more
common
in
busy
areas
and
at
busy
crossings
Accidents
are
inevitable
as
there
is
always
going
to
be
one
bad
driver
who
misjudges
the
situation
and
ends
up
knocking
down
a
pedestrian
There
is
nothing
more
frustrating
for
the
Motorist
than
a
pedestrian
slowing
down
their
journey
so
it
is
important
to
establish
if
you
have
suffered
a
pedestrian
injury
that
you
were
in
no
way
the
cause
of
your
own
accident
If
you
were
crossing
the
road
when
the
light
turned
green
you
may
find
it
harder
to
gain
compensation
Nonetheless
if
you
know
it
was
not
your
fault
then
hiring
a
personal
injury
lawyer
should
reassure
you
that
all
is
being
done
to
get
you
the
compensation
that
you
feel
you
deserve

Which
personal
injuries
are
classed
as
catastrophic
and
how
do
you
go
about
getting
compensation
Posted
by
Catastrophic
personal
injuries
are
usually
best
demonstrated
by
medical
evidence
and
the
amount
of
medical
treatment
the
victim
has
had
These
injuries
are
life
changing
and
therefore
a
pursuit
of
compensation
is
the
most
important
things
to
cover
for
medical
bills
the
costs
of
treatment
and
any
trauma
suffered
as
a
result
Legal
action
should
be
undertaken
no
more
than
three
years
from
the
emergence
of
symptoms
from
the
injury
You
should
hire
a
personal
injury
lawyer
to
see
to
your
case
if
you
can
establish
it
was
caused
by
the
negligence
of
someone
else
they
will
work
to
get
you
the
compensation
you
are
entitled
There
are
five
categories
of
catastrophic
injury
and
these
are
brain
injuries
burns
paralysis
amputation
and
blindness
Brain
injuries
are
very
serious
in
terms
of
future
quality
of
life
and
can
be
temporary
or
permanent
If
it
is
permanent
there
is
a
greater
urgency
for
compensation
if
caused
by
negligence
as
you
will
probably
never
work
again
and
will
need
future
medical
bills
paid
Vehicle
accidents
for
example
can
cause
brain
damage
and
it
is
important
that
it
is
fully
established
that
the
accident
was
not
your
fault
You
will
need
a
full
account
of
events
and
witness
evidence
will
be
absolutely
crucial
here
for
your
personal
injury
claim
There
should
also
be
medical
evidence
your
personal
injury
lawyer
will
see
to
this
Paralysis
may
involve
impaired
bodily
functions
in
areas
such
as
neck
and
spinal
cord
as
a
result
of
an
accident
that
could
have
been
prevented
If
it
leads
to
a
loss
of
mobility
it
is
more
than
likely
you
will
not
be
able
to
work
for
a
long
period
of
time
or
ever
again
Burns
are
considered
a
catastrophic
injury
because
of
their
severity
If
it
has
happened
to
a
child
for
example
the
effects
can
be
permanent
and
so
a
personal
injury
claim
will
be
needed
The
steps
to
compensation
here
would
be
to
hire
a
skilled
lawyer
but
also
to
establish
the
negligence
Burn
injury
cases
tend
to
be
no
win
no
fee
If
you
were
unaware
of
workplace
hazards
handled
dangerous
substances
without
any
health
and
safety
advice
or
had
something
hot
spilt
on
you
claiming
compensation
should
not
be
hard
Negligence
will
be
the
key
determinant
of
the
personal
injury
lawyers
case
Amputation
and
blindness
mean
that
a
body
part
is
no
longer
functional
and
so
this
is
a
big
case
for
personal
injury
lawyers
if
negligence
can
be
established
Amputation
and
blindness
are
serious
and
it
is
important
to
get
witnesses
to
these
events
as
with
such
a
serious
case
negligence
being
established
is
crucial
This
can
be
established
on
witness
evidence
alone
Hiring
a
specialist
personal
injury
lawyer
will
help
with
your
compensation
claim
Because
of
the
lifetime
of
medical
care
that
may
be
needed
it
is
crucial
you
hire
someone
who
knows
what
they
are
doing
Research
their
credentials
and
the
cases
they
have
been
involved
in
For
example
a
child
with
severe
burns
all
over
their
body
who
requires
nonstop
medical
attention
should
have
the
best
representation
and
the
best
evidence
of
negligence
possible
A
good
personal
injury
lawyer
will
make
sure
of
this
These
catastrophic
injuries
stand
out
because
of
the
effect
they
have
on
peoples
lives
There
are
simple
things
to
do
to
make
sure
life
can
be
bearable
with
compensation
and
this
involves
establishing
the
full

the

obtaining

injuries
and

itself

Top
tips
for
dealing
with
whiplash
Posted
by
It
is
in
no
way
difficult
to
make
a
personal
injury
claim
for
whiplash
as
the
effects
can
produce
a
lot
of
discomfort
and
pain
Whiplash
is
mainly
caused
by
car
accidents
and
this
is
the
rapid
force
of
head
moving
back
and
forth
resulting
in
muscle
and
tendon
damage
Whiplash
is
a
common
accident
claim
and
averages
a
quarter
of
a
million
claims
in
the
UK
each
year
That
is
why
it
is
important
to
understand
how
to
deal
with
whiplash
and
how
to
go
forward
from
there
The
first
tip
to
deal
with
whiplash
is
to
know
the
symptoms
Symptoms
of
whiplash
injuries
often
vary
Typical
symptoms
include
stiffness
and
pain
in
neck
back
and
shoulder
pain
arm
numbness
dizziness
and
blurred
vision
tiredness
and
concentration
problems
as
well
as
ringing
ears
By
knowing
the
symptoms
you
can
further
establish
the
scale
of
your
claim
You
may
also
need
a
scan
at
the
hospital
and
so
is
best
to
keep
a
record
of
this
for
your
personal
injury
claim
Then
will
be
the
injury
claim
for
whiplash
The
effects
of
whiplash
vary
greatly
You
may
have
months
of
discomfort
and
it
may
affect
your
quality
of
life
It
may
also
affect
your
regular
job
and
affect
your
performance
You
may
therefore
feel
that
you
are
entitled
to
compensation
You
should
make
a
whiplash
injury
claim
straight
away
If
it
is
a
road
accident
you
will
need
the
details
of
the
injured
party
as
this
will
make
them
contactable
the
insurance
company
contactable
and
allow
better
proof
of
cause
of
accident
that
led
to
the
injury
An
important
step
is
to
hire
a
personal
injury
lawyer
one
who
specialises
in
whiplash
cases
This
will
help
you
with
the
process
of
claiming
compensation
for
the
injury
The
Solicitor
s
duty
is
to
win
compensation
and
they
will
stop
at
nothing
to
insure
that
so
there
are
no
further
worries
as
to
how
your
claim
will
develop
You
should
also
carry
the
results
from
the
hospital
with
you
such
as
type
of
scan
date
of
admittance
and
the
name
of
the
Doctor
who
treated
you
These
are
the
tools
the
Solicitor
needs
to
build
your
case
and
armed
with
proof
it
would
be
hard
for
you
not
to
win
the
claim
if
you
have
these
important
documents
with
you
If
you
win
you
will
get
100
of
the
compensation
as
all
bills
and
costs
are
paid
by
those
who
lose
the
case
If
you
lose
the
solicitor
pays
your
costs
so
there
really
is
nothing
to
lose
with
a
personal
injury
claim
Therefore
these
tips
for
dealing
with
whiplash
are
quite
straightforward
You
need
to
be
aware
of
the
symptoms
you
have
and
if
needs
be
get
a
medical
report
from
the
Doctor
who
treats
you
for
whiplash
They
will
need
to
weigh
up
how
much
it
has
affected
you
but
the
most
important
thing
is
to
hire
a
personal
injury
lawyer
who
will
relieve
any
worries
you
have
about
your
case

The
importance
of
taking
photos
of
a
car
accident
to
assist
with
a
claim
Posted
by
Taking
photos
of
a
car
accident
is
integral
and
virtually
seals
the
deal
when
making
a
compensation
claim
A
photo
is
very
useful
as
it
is
the
main
piece
of
evidence
that
can
convince
the
insurance
company
and
the
court
It
can
seriously
dispel
any
claim
made
by
the
assailant
that
they
did
not
do
it
therefore
making
it
vital
that
a
photograph
is
taken
at
the
accident
scene
as
the
photograph
would
show
the
whole
accident
The
photo
can
also
show
the
extent
of
your
injuries
The
amount
awarded
on
injury
claims
often
relate
to
the
amount
of
evidence
and
that
is
why
photos
are
so
important
The
photo
can
also
show
the
true
extent
of
the
damage
to
your
car
If
for
example
you
describe
the
damage
backed
up
by
photographic
evidence
it
is
very
unlikely
you
would
lose
the
claim
It
is
also
important
to
take
photos
at
different
angles
to
allow
a
full
assessment
of
the
damage
You
also
should
take
a
picture
of
the
car
that
hit
you
as
then
it
would
be
plain
to
see
by
the
scale
of
its
damage
that
they
were
the
car
that
hit
you
This
should
also
cover
the
road
in
case
of
any
debris
or
parts
of
the
car
that
are
on
the
road
again
establishing
the
scale
of
the
accident
These
should
be
zoomed
in
and
out
and
taken
from
a
distance
Finally
the
skid
marks
can
also
be
taken
if
it
was
an
impact
crash
also
incorporate
photos
of
any
injuries
suffered
Photos
therefore
build
a
picture
of
the
accident
showing
the
lawyers
the
full
scale
of
events
and
damaged
suffered
You
should
also
include
the
street
name
and
traffic
signs
If
you
could
get
a
photograph
of
traffic
signs
it
would
immensely
improve
your
chances
of
getting
a
good
payout
especially
if
there
was
a
specific
speed
limit
or
little
or
heavy
traffic
as
each
show
the
hazards
leading
to
an
accident
Impact
photos
have
been
capitalised
on
by
many
insurance
companies
Some
have
even
encouraged
photo
documentation
and
have
sent
disposable
cameras
out
to
customers
Some
even
include
a
little
notebook
or
piece
of
paper
to
write
down
extra
details
That
is
why
it
is
strongly
encouraged
to
take
photos
of
a
car
accident
to
assist
with
an
accident
claim
Photos
are
great
memory
refreshers
of
the
accident
and
may
even
bring
about
new
details
that
you
had
not
remembered
before
For
example
it
may
identify
more
damage
than
you
originally
made
note
of
at
the
time
The
piecing
together
of
the
accident
is
integral
and
photos
are
the
best
source
of
visual
evidence
and
can
contribute
to
a
successful
car
accident
claim

Injuries
to
the
eye
where
to
go
for
help
and
compensation
Posted
by
The
eye
is
one
of
the
most
important
and
sensitive
parts
on
a
human
body
Despite
the
fact
that
eyelashes
eyebrows
and
the
sockets
of
the
skull
in
which
they
sit
injuries
in
this
area
are
very
common
and
can
be
irritating
painful
and
can
be
life
altering
Eye
injuries
can
occur
in
sporting
accidents
car
crashes
and
industrial
accidents
It
is
estimated
that
over
120
000
people
sustain
personal
injuries
to
their
eye
each
year
in
the
UK
One
of
the
most
common
eye
injuries
is
when
a
small
object
becomes
lodged
in
the
outer
surface
of
the
eye
Symptoms
include
pain
and
associated
tears
blurred
vision
sensitivity
to
light
and
the
eye
naturally
tries
to
get
rid
of
the
object
unsuccessfully
This
type
of
injury
usually
occurs
in
an
industry
using
metal
or
certain
materials
being
grounded
down
Under
the
pressure
small
shards
or
parts
of
the
material
may
fly
off
and
enter
the
eye
at
speed
If
the
industry
has
not
provided
you
with
goggles
or
eye
protection
you
can
seek
a
personal
injury
claim
against
them
for
not
providing
the
right
health
and
safety
equipment
Eye
injuries
at
work
are
very
common
such
as
chemicals
steam
or
fumes
irritating
the
eyes
This
can
cause
burning
sensations
loss
of
vision
and
redness
For
example
kitchen
workers
can
be
exposed
to
hot
fat
and
steam
which
can
cause
serious
damage
if
they
enter
the
eyes
Slips
falls
and
bumps
can
often
result
in
an
eye
injury
as
the
cornea
might
become
ruptured
or
damaged
Other
signs
of
eye
injuries
may
include
extensive
bleeding
a
line
of
blood
inside
the
eye
visible
at
the
bottom
of
the
cornea
any
greyness
visible
any
visible
irregularity
a
change
in
the
shape
of
the
pupil
and
loss
of
the
firmness
of
the
eye
If
any
of
these
symptoms
occur
to
you
seek
medical
advice
immediately
So
how
much
could
you
claim
for
an
eye
injury
that
wasn
t
your
fault
Apart
from
the
necessity
to
have
goggles
or
eye
protection
in
the
workplace
when
needed
it
is
the
employer
s
job
to
adequately
train
workers
on
how
best
to

Personal

claims
such

vary
hugely
depending
on
the
damage
caused
and
how
long
the
damage
will
last
Minor

there
could
be

is
the
unfortunate

the

could
range

these

are

Concise
Outline
Of
Choosing
An
Injury
Law
Firm
Posted
by
A
personal
injury
law
firm
deals
with
individuals
who
have
been
hurt
or
injured
due
to
the
negligence
or
actions
of
others
Sometimes
people
are
hurt
badly
and
hire
these
types
of
organization
to
help
recoup
some
money
that
they
feel
they
are
owed
for
going
through
such
a
process
Individuals
should
make
sure
they
make
a
good
choice
in
who
they
hire
to
represent
them
These
kinds
of
lawyers
will
have
been
trained
in
various
areas
of
legal
practice
but
will
most
likely
only
be
directly
involved
with
things
having
to
do
with
tort
law
This
will
be
their
area
of
specialization
and
they
will
be
quite
knowledgeable
in
it
Clients
need
not
be
worried
that
such
professionals
will
run
into
serious
road
bumps
related
to
obscure
technicalities
Work
injuries
are
a
big
part
of
the
practice
This
is
particularly
true
if
a
company
was
following
a
policy
that
was
not
safe
and
put
an
individual
at
risk
If
that
individual
then
gets
hurt
he
she
probably
has
the
right
to
sue
This
is
why
most
companies
put
such
a
high
emphasis
on
being
safe
Without
this
they
can
potentially
face
law
suits
Products
that
don
t
work
right
and
end
up
causing
harm
might
also
allow
one
to
turn
to
the
legal
system
for
recourse
Toys
that
have
been
constructed
with
toxic
material
for
example
can
cause
harm
to
young
children
If
the
company
was
aware
of
this
but
did
not
make
an
effort
to
change
its
practices
then
it
can
be
sued
often
quite
severely
for
monetary
compensation
Even
the
field
of
medicine
spawns
suits
against
practitioners
that
do
not
know
what
they
are
doing
or
that
make
mistakes
Surgeries
that
are
performed
incorrectly
or
medication
that
is
given
in
the
wrong
dosage
can
certainly
causes
injury
sometimes
permanent
People
need
to
be
aware
of
which
firms
in
their
area
will
be
available
to
help
them
in
case
this
does
occur
Automobile
accidents
often
involve
people
that
are
under
insured
or
uninsured
This
can
become
a
tangled
legal
mess
when
one
or
the
other
party
suffers
injuries
A
legal
firm
that
specializes
in
dealing
with
this
kind
of
stuff
is
the
way
to
go
They
will
be
able
to
represent
people
and
find
ways
around
the
problem
that
will
allow
a
client
to
move
on
with
his
her
life

Texting
Officially
Banned
for
Truck
and
Bus
Drivers
Posted
by
Texting
while
driving
has
become
a
huge
problem
for
law
enforcement
in
the
past
couple
years
Texting
while
driving
makes
a
driver
23
times
more
likely
to
crash
compared
to
focused
driving
Not
only
are
the
chances
for
collision
higher
but
the
odds
of
serious
injury
are
increased
as
well
Texting
and
driving
has
become
a
widespread
issue
with
the
total
number
of
text
messages
sent
last
year
totaling
over
22
times
higher
than
just
four
years
ago
With
such
heightened
risk
it
s
no
surprise
that
law
enforcement
has
been
looking
to
crack
down
on
texting
and
driving
It
is
estimated
by
the
FMSCA
that
every
time
a
driver
types
a
text
message
they
take
their
eyes
off
the
road
for
4
6
out
of
every
6
seconds
If
the
driver
were
going
55
mph
that
seemingly
quick
4
6
seconds
would
actually
be
a
football
field
in
distance
traveled
without
once
looking
at
the
road
In
March
U
S
Transportation
Secretary
Ray
LaHood
announced
a
new
federal
rule
to
ban
texting
while
driving
specific
to
truck
drivers
and
commercial
bus
drivers
carrying
more
than
8
passengers
We
want
the
drivers
of
big
rigs
and
buses
and
those
who
share
the
roads
with
them
to
be
safe
said
Secretary
LaHood
This
is
an
important
safety
step
and
we
will
be
taking
more
to
eliminate
the
threat
of
distracted
driving
The
consequence
of
texting
and
driving
for
these
truck
and
bus
drivers
will
be
a
civil
or
criminal
penalty
of
up
to
2
750
While
many
groups
are
showing
great
support
of
the
new
ruling
quite
a
few
groups
such
as
the
American
Association
for
Justice
feel
the
rule
does
not
go
far
enough
The
final
ruling
only
prohibits
personal
phones
and
communication
devices
and
many
groups
feel
that
on
board
computers
and
communications
equipment
can
also
be
very
distracting
This
might
be
a
more
difficult
battle
to
win
since
many
operators
need
to
be
contacted
in
cases
of
emergency
and
many
trucking
Associations
will
want
to
have
their
say
Both
the
American
Bus
Association
as
well
as
the
American
Trucking
Association
have
shown
support
for
the
texting
while
driving
law
If
nothing
else
this
new
ruling
will
help
set
a
precedent
for
the
low
tolerance
of
texting
while
driving
and
many
feel
that
an
extension
to
all
drivers
may
be
coming
soon
Texting
and
driving
has
driven
up
the
risk
for
collision
and
serious
personal
injury
therefore
banning
texting
and
driving
altogether
would
have
little
to
no
consequence
As

experienced
Killeen

injury
attorney

believe
that
prevention
is
the
answer
to
personal
injury

What
is
post
traumatic
stress
Posted
by
Post
traumatic
stress
affects
thousands
of
people
every
year
It
s
a
psychological
and
physical
condition
that
is
caused
by
a
distressing
and
frightening
event
someone
has
experienced
According
to
statistics
it
occurs
in
up
to
30
of
people
who
have
experienced
a
personal
injury
or
traumatic
event
such
as
a
serious
road
accident
terrorist
attack
and
military
combat
or
even
robbery
The
disorder
was
recognised
during
World
War
One
when
soldiers
had
distressing
and
horrific
memories
and
nightmares
of
their
time
spent
in
the
trenches
and
war
People
who
suffer
from
post
traumatic
stress
disorder
often
experiences
flashbacks
and
nightmares
which
lead
to
trouble
sleeping
concentrating
and
feeling
detached
from
everyday
life
after
their
for
personal
injury
Symptoms
tend
to
happen
straight
after
the
event
occurs
but
sometimes
it
takes
several
months
or
even
years
after
the
trauma
for
the
disorder
to
take
impact
Post
traumatic
stress
disorder
is
common
in
certain
groups
For
example
one
in
five
fire
fighters
and
one
in
two
female
rape
victims
suffer
the
disorder
due
to
the
horror
and
helplessness
they
experience
Anyone
can
be
at
risk
of
post
traumatic
stress
disorder
if
they
are
exposed
to
a
traumatic
event
Risks
such
as
lack
of
education
coming
from
a
poor
background
and
even
being
female
make
you
more
vulnerable
to
the
disorder
But
what
are
the
symptoms
Recurring
memories
and
flashbacks
of
the
trauma
that
tend
to
be
distressing
and
because
of
this
you
tend
to
avoid
places
people
and
conversations
that
may
trigger
these
flashbacks
Feeling
emotionally
numb
and
loosing
loving
feelings
towards
loved
ones
People
suffering
the
disorder
tend
to
be
pessimistic
about
the
future
and
loose
interest
in
their
hobbies
and
activities
they
use
to
enjoy
before
the
event
Difficulty
to
fall
asleep
outbursts
of
anger
increased
vigilance
difficulty
concentrating
and
they
are
often
startled
easily
by
unexpected
actions
Don
t
be
alarmed
if
you
feel
upset
or
distressed
after
a
traumatic
event
this
is
natural
and
tends
to
ease
off
over
the
months
Post
traumatic
stress
individuals
have
the
disorder
long
term
and
four
out
of
five
people
suffer
other
mental
problems
such
as
depression
phobias
or
drug
and
alcohol
abuse
On
the
other
hand
there
are
treatments
available
for
those
suffering
but
if
the
symptoms
are
only
mild
and
the
trauma
happened
less
than
a
month
ago
treatment
may
not
be
needed
Medication
can
be
offered
to
reduce
anxiety
but
there
are
non
medication
treatments
available
Talking
treatments
such
as
anxiety
management
counselling
or
group
therapy
can
help
sufferers
learn
how
to
relax
and
get
back
on
train
with
their
lives
Cognitive
behavioural
therapy
can
be
advised
where
a
specialist
will
help
to
change
your
ways
of
thinking
and
create
a
routine
in
doing
so
However
sufferers
should
be
aware
that
no
treatment
will
wipe
the
slate
clean
and
self
help
will
be
needed
to
erase
the
distressing
memories
If
a
post
traumatic
stress
has
occurred
to
you
and
you
want
compensation
a
personal
injury
lawyer
can
represent
your
case
and
claim
you
money
of
up
to
55
000
if
the
incident
was
severe

Personal
Injury
Claims
Against
Government
Entities
Posted
by
Formulating
a
personal
injury
claim
against
a
government
entity
including
that
of
a
local
state
or
federal
group
can
be
tricky
and
often
times
complicated
There
are
several
steps
that
must
be
taken
to
guarantee
that
your
claim
can
be
filed
and
that
it
may
proceed
within
a
court
of
law
So
what
are
these
necessary
steps
and
what
how
is
filing
a
personal
injury
claim
against
a
government
entity
any
different
than
filing
that
of
an
average
personal
injury
claim
There
are
many
types
of
personal
injuries
that
can
be
considered
with
respects
to
filing
a
legal
claim
These
may
include
that
of
medical
malpractice
wrongful
death
auto
and
motorcycle
injuries
and
many
more
If
an
individual
chooses
to
file
a
claim
it
will
most
likely
be
against
another
individual
group
or
company
In
some
cases
that
group
or
entity
is
backed
by
or
in
completeness
a
government
or
government
funded
entity
There
are
specific
rules
and
laws
that
exist
when
filing
a
claim
against
a
government
entity
This
includes
that
of
a
Notice
of
Claim
In
most
all
cases
this
Notice
of
Claim
must
be
filed
within
sixty
days
of
the
accident
and
or
injury
If
it
has
been
longer
than
this
or
if
you
wish
to
have
professional
help
from
an
experienced
personal
injury
lawyer
it
is
best
to
contact
them
immediately
This
Notice
of
Claim
must
even
be
filed
in
a
situations
involving
that
of
a
federal
state
or
local
government
employee
no
matter
how
small
their
matter
of
involvement
may
have
been
To

sure

injury
attorney
to
get
the
facts
on
what
you
need
to
do
to
correctly
file
your
claim
What
is
a
Notice
of
Claim
This
document
informs
the
government
that
you
were
injured
and
are
in
fact
proceeding
with
filing
a
legal
claim
This
gives
the
government
a
time
frame
in
which
to
respond
After
the
response
has
been
sent
your
claim
will
either
be
accepted
or
denied
completely
Again
with
the
professional
assistance
of
a
legal
team
your
chances
for
getting
your
claim
accepted
are
far
higher
than
doing
so
without
The
seemingly
grey
area
with
respects
to
filing
a
claim
against
a
government
agency
is
that
of
government
affiliated
and
or
funded
agencies
These
are
not
directly
local
state
or
federal
government
associations
although
they
do
have
some
connection
with
such
Some
states
treat
these
affiliates
with
different
laws
and
regulations
while
other
lump
them
all
into
one
It
s
best
to
see
where
you
stand
with
respects
to
who
you
are
attempting
to
file
a
suit
against
prior
to
filing
the
claim
Personal
injury
claims
can
be
complicated
enough
without
adding
the
additional
stresses
of
it
being
in
relation
to
a
government
entity
It
is
your
right
as
a
United
States
citizen
to
file
a
claim
against
anyone
who
has
caused
you
injury
and
or
damages
due
to
negligence
even
if
that
anyone
is
related
to
or
directly
that
of
a
government
entity

How
Can
One
Help
Posted
by
Many
of
the
patients
afflicted
with
mesothelioma
are
victims
of
asbestos
exposure
at
work
They
may
have
worked
in
an
environment
where
they
inhaled
harmful
asbestos
fibers
Thus
many
feel
that
responsibility
for
the
workers
illnesses
should
be
placed
with
asbestos
manufacturers
whose
ignorance
or
negligence
likely
led
to
the
development
of
the
cancer
Filing
an
asbestos
cancer
lawsuit
is
a
common
choice
for
patients
suffering
from
this
serious
ailment
In
order
to
file
such
a
claim
however
one
must
first
find
an
experienced
mesothelioma
lawyer
to
serve
as
a
guide
and
advisor
throughout
the
process
To
find
a
high
quality
mesothelioma
lawyer
one
must
scrutinize
several
criteria
the
attorney
s
related
experience
the
lawyer
s
general
reputation
his
or
her
skill
as
measured
by
past
case
success
rates
and
the
individual
attorney
s
personality
Interviewing
a
mesothelioma
lawyer
is
one
of
the
best
ways
to
understand
his
her
abilities
Gathering
evidence
to
support
the
case
is
very
important
This
is
one
of
the
vital
points
of
case
preparation
that
benefits
from
an
experienced
mesothelioma
lawyer
Missing
minute
details
can
make
have
huge
adverse
affects
on
the
case
Specific
and
accurate
information
about
the
time
and
date
of
diagnosis
the
work
conditions
which
led
to
the
patient
s
asbestos
exposure
witnesses
and
medical
bills
and
other
expenses
must
be
gathered
and
documented
properly
The
specific
amount
of
money
awarded
in
these
cases
varies
based
on
facts
such
as
severity
of
manufacturer
negligence
patient
s
mental
suffering
physical
afflictions
loss
of
time
labor
and
money
and
more
A
mesothelioma
lawyer
must
complete
a
thorough
quantitative
analysis
to
determine
the
appropriate
amount
to
request
from
the
manufacturer
A
mesothelioma
lawyer
should
be
familiar
with
the
standard
trial
process
and
proceedings
Though
many
of
these
types
of
cases
settle
out
of
court
there
is
the
possibility
that
a
case
will
go
to
trial
in
which
case
an
experienced
mesothelioma
trial
attorney
will
be
imperative
Since
these
cases
are
generally
tried
before
a
jury
charisma
in
addition
to
knowledge
and
skill
will
be
important

Some
Guidelines
Posted
by
Mesothelioma
is
a
type
of
cancer
that
affects
the
lining
of
organs
often
the
lungs
Being
exposed
to
asbestos
fibers
particularly
over
long
periods
of
time
can
make
a
person
at
higher
risk
for
developing
this
type
of
cancer
Research
has
shown
that
manufacturing
workers
who
deal
with
asbestos
product
production
are
at
high
risk
for
development
Thus
mesothelioma
is
often
considered
an
occupational
cancer
Those
whose
lives
are
affected
by
this
cancer
will
face
many
difficulties
during
their
illnesses
First
the
medical
treatments
required
are
quite
costly
and
health
insurance
is
not
always
sufficient
to
buffer
those
costs
To
make
matters
worse
patients
are
often
too
ill
to
continuing
working
meaning
their
income
disappears
as
their
costs
mount
The
emotional
physical
and
financial
suffering
of
patients
and
their
families
can
hardly
be
imagined
Because
this
disease
is
usually
linked
to
asbestos
exposure
on
the
job
patients
can
sometimes
file
claims
against
asbestos
manufacturers
for
compensation
To
help
with
the
complicated
legal
proceedings
one
first
must
find
an
experienced
asbestos
attorney
An
asbestos
attorney
is
one
whose
practice
focuses
on
cases
related
to
asbestos
related
cancers
Due
to
this
concentrated
focus
an
asbestos
attorney
will
be
more
experienced
in
and
posses
more
first
hand
knowledge
of
trying
this
type
of
case
Choosing
the
correct
asbestos
attorney
is
a
prime
concern
as
it
s
a
decision
that
can
mean
the
difference
between
winning
and
losing
a
case
It
requires
intense
research
and
interviews
to
select
an
asbestos
attorney
Once
selected
the
asbestos
attorney
will
be
required
to
do
some
research
of
his
her
own
First
and
foremost
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
workplace
must
be
executed
in
order
to
prove
asbestos
exposure
occurred
An
asbestos
attorney
will
also
need
to
gather
information
related
to
the
medical
history
of
the
patient
prior
to
contracting
the
cancer
to
show
whether
or
not
the
patient
was
otherwise
healthy
prior
to
the
cancer
diagnosis

Texting
while

is
more
dangerous
than
previously
thought
a
new
Texas
study
shows
Writing
or
reading
a
text
message
behind
the
wheel
can
drastically
slow
down
a
driver
s
reaction
time
according
to
a
study
released
Wednesday
by
the
Texas
Transportation
Institute
Texting
while
driving
basically
doubles
a
driver
s
reaction
time
and
makes
the
driver
less
able
to
respond
to
sudden
roadway
dangers
if
a
vehicle
were
to
make
a
sudden
stop
in
front
of
them
or
if
a
child
was
to
run
across
the
road
said
researcher
Christine
Yager
who
managed
the
study
Reaction
times
slowed
from
one
to
two
seconds
with
no
texting
to
three
to
four
seconds
while

the

The
study
also
found
very
little
difference
in
response
times
between
a
driver
composing
a
message
and
a
driver
reading

If

is
60
in

said
Researchers
studied
42
drivers
between
the
ages

16

Personal
Injury
Lawyers
Can
Assist
with
More
than
Seeking
Compensation
Posted
by
Any
person
involved
in
an
accident
needs
to
be
aware
of
the
beneficial
opportunities
or
compensations
with
regards
to
the
financial
moral
and
medical
factors
Approaching
injury
lawyers
can
help
with
more
than
just
gaining
compensation
Through
professional
expertise
the
legal
representatives
can
offer
a
wide
range
of
services
between
the
basic
legal
advice
and
the
final
settlement
Gathering
the
key
evidence
and
developing
first
rate
legal
documents
to
present
the
client
s
case
in
the
best
light
possible
are
only
the
main
services
available
when
using
expert
injury
lawyers
It
all
begins
with
presenting
the
legal
options
The
injured
party
may
not
be
aware
of
the
wide
choice
of
possibilities
available
to
him
after
the
ensued
incident
Sometimes
the
opportunities
are
limited
or
hidden
by
the
insurers
of
the
responsible
party
to
prevent
any
loss
which
might
be
forced
on
their
client
The
service
provided
by
the
personal
injury
lawyer
is
a
thorough
analysis
of
all
possibilities
followed
by
a
consultancy
to
help
the
client
decide
which
approach
would
be
best
Personal
injury
lawyers
generally
operate
based
on
a
no
win
no
fee
policy
As
a
result
the
client
s
best
interest
is
a
priority
The
second
phase
of
building
a
case
is
gathering
all
essential
evidence
Personal
injury
lawyers
assist
with
locating
witnesses
and
acquiring
valuable
information
through
testimonies
obtaining
access
to
accident
sites
and
performing
a
thorough
examination
of
the
incident
Some
representatives
also
work
in
attaining
photographic
and
documented
proof
of
both
physical
and
psychological
damage
cause
to
the
victim
and
his
possessions
All
these
findings
are
included
in
reports
which
certify
the
impact
of
the
incident
The
next
stage
involves
representative
services
This
facility
is
highly
beneficial
if
the
client
suffered
severe
injuries
and
cannot
be
present
at
all
legal
settlements
with
the
responsible
party
The
lawyer
represents
the
client
s
needs
and
desires
completely
even
if
the
case
is
due
to
go
to
court
The
basic
settlements
are
another
service
from
which
clients
can
benefit
as
most
people
involved
in
an
accident
prefer
to
settle
their
businesses
outside
court
to
avoid
a
public
scandal
and
additional
expenses
This
type
of
settlement
is
highly
encouraged
by
lawyers
representing
both
parties
to
save
clients
more
time
and
money
The
compensation
fee
and
other
services
are
decided
by
the
injured
client
and
the
realistic
approach
is
decided
by
the
final
advice
provided
by
the
lawyer
The
final
proceedings
can
be
handled
by
the
legal
representative
who
negotiates
the
settlement
fee
as
close
to
the
client
s
goal
as
possible
An
accident
can
be
a
traumatizing
experience
for
the
people
involved
and
their
families
which
is
why
all
the
technicalities
need
to
be
performed
by
qualified
individuals
to
ensure
that
both
parties
receive
what
they
deserve
Accident
victims
need
to
be
aware
of
two
important
aspects
when
handling
the
consequences
of
the
incident
first
of
all
no
person
should
give
elaborate
information
about
what
happened
without
getting
initial
advice
from
a
legal
representative
Only
the
basic
and
strictly
necessary
information
should
be
provided
when
being
questioned
by
the
authorities
Secondly
one
should
never
try
to
tackle
the
situation
with
the
other
party
alone
as
the
victim
can
endanger
his
chances
of
having
a
strong
case
By
taking
account
of
the
two
necessities
the
personal
injury
lawyer
can
begin
to
solve
the
case
straightaway

People
who
have
experienced
accidents
in
their
lifetime
are
instantly
subsidised
by
the
law
The
system
provides
distinct
privileges
to
injured
parties
and
ensures
that
all
those
involved
in
an
accident
receive
the
fair
quality
of
treatment
they
deserve
However
these
privileges
can
be
missed
out
on
by
underestimating
the
value
of
the
case
in
hand
or
by
delaying
the
initiation
of
an
injury
claim
Consequences
of
these
actions
can
result
in
lost
evidence
vague
witness
testimonies
and
the
limited
amount
of
time
in
which
legal
action
can
be
pursued
can
expire
To
maximize
the
value
of
the
rights
as
an
injured
party
one
must
choose
the
appropriate
legal
representative
By
approaching
the
right
injury
lawyer
the
risk
of
losing
certain
opportunities
can
be
reduced
In
order
to
make
the
right
choice
an
individual
must
take
account
of
criterions
such
as
reputation
experience
and
the
package
provided
In
the
end
the
correct
decision
can
be
rewarded
with
a
substantial
benefit
included
of
both
financial
and
servicing
compensations
The
first
factor
to
look
for
when
choosing
the
right
personal
injury
lawyer
is
the
experience
Whether
it
involves
a
website
a
recommendation
from
a
close
friend
or
a
newspaper
ad
a
person
should
always
try
to
find
out
as
much
as
possible
about
his
potential
legal
representative
This
involves
looking
at
the
professional
s
background
The
years
of
practice
are
not
as
important
as
the
rate
of
cases
won
and
the
rate
of
cases
lost
References
are
also
very
helpful
when
choosing
to
form
a
partnership
Considering
that
an
injury
case
is
a
highly
important
legal
aspect
providing
that
information
should
not
be
a
problem
if
the
recommendations
are
not
available
on
site
Depending
on
the
severity
of
the
case
one
might
consider
hiring
a
lawyer
specialized
in
the
type
of
accident
incurred
If
the
accident
does
not
constitute
a
complicated
event
or
any
great
damages
an
injury
lawyer
with
a
general
expertise
will
be
adequate
From
a
client
s
perspective
it
is
highly
important
to
know
that
all
the
available
opportunities
are
being
further
explored
to
ensure
the
success
of
one
s
case
At
the
outset
a
good
injury
lawyer
will
always
make
sure
that
the
injured
client
will
get
medical
examination
and
treatment
to
prevent
the
condition
from
getting
any
worse
If
the
client
cannot
find
a
doctor
he
will
be
provided
with
one
immediately
The
personal
injury
lawyer
should
be
able
to
instruct
his
client
effectively
to
not
sign
anything
or
give
any
statements
without
his
consent
to
not
accept
any
offers
or
visit
the
doctors
recommended
by
the
adjuster
A
respectable
personal
injury
lawyer
works
by
a
no
win
no
fee
policy
and
ensures
100
client
compensation
which
are
proof
that
the
lawyer
will
look
after
the
client
s
best
interest
and
support
the
legal
procedures
successfully
The
first
interaction
a
client
has
with
his
potential
legal
representative
is
by
phone
call
It
is
highly
important
that
the
injury
lawyer
inspires
confidence
and
enables
the
individual
to
communicate
freely
with
him
This
is
a
highly
important
criterion
when
choosing
the
ideal
legal
representative
as
the
client
needs
the
reassurance
that
his
lawyer
will
fight
for
his
rights
effectively

Tips
and
tricks
to
ensure
a
successful
accident
claim
Posted
by
To
most
filing
an
accident
claim
of
any
kind
can
be
a
great
hassle
and
burden
But
if
you
are
the
victim
of
someone
else
s
negligence
by
way
of
injury
or
damage
to
your
property
it
is
essential
that
you
take
the
opportunity
to
claim
whatever
you
are
entitled
to
Follow
these
handy
hints
and
tips
to
ensure
you
are
not
left
in
the
dark
when
it
comes
to
making
a
claim
and
that
you
walk
away
with
the
best
possible
outcome
Don
t
panic
At
the
scene
of
any
accident
especially
a
car
accident
it
is
very
easy
to
panic
in
the
knowledge
that
you
are
partly
responsible
for
holding
up
traffic
2
miles
behind
Worse
still
if
people
including
yourself
have
sustained
injuries
your
initial
reaction
will
be
to
panic
get
agitated
and
play
the
blame
game
Avoid
over
analysing
things
at
this
stage
Using
a
road
accident
as
an
example
all
you
can
do
at
this
stage
is
exchange
contact
details
with
the
other
party
to
further
arrange
a
settlement
with
the
relevant
insurance
company
If
the
accident
has
occurred
at
work
or
in
the
home
due
to
a
faulty
product
or
piece
of
equipment
the
company
should
proceed
to
look
immediately
into
how
and
why
the
incident
happened
Following
an
accident
or
injury
within
the
home
at
the
hands
of
a
faulty
product
a
complaint
should
be
made
as
soon
as
possible
with
the
relevant
manufacturer
Be
thorough
Before
filing
an
accident
claim
you
should
have
sufficient
evidence
to
back
it
up
Supplying
a
solicitor
with
the
basic
outline
will
do
you
no
favours
in
the
long
run
so
be
prepared
with
all
the
necessary
information
Be
sure
to
adequately
research
your
accident
location
taking
photos
at
the
scene
of
the
accident
gathering
eye
witnesses
etc
It
is
also
vital
that
you
record
time
off
work
to
conduct
the
research
Think
ahead

My
Rights
As
An
Employee
Posted
by
As
an
employee
many
questions
about
specific
rules
and
rights
that
come
with
it
can
be
raised
throughout
employment
This
is
rightly
so
as
you
should
be
informed
of
the
rights
and
limitations
that
an
employer
has
regarding
your
work
From
hiring
to
firing
and
everything
in
between
specific
topics
should
be
discussed
regarding
the
rules
These
specific
laws
vary
from
state
to
state
so
if
you
have
serious
concerns
or
questions
consider
contacting
a
local
law
firm
to
help
you
review
your
rights
as
an
employee
of
your
current
career
At
the
hiring
process
one
of
the
most
commonly
asked
questions
by
employees
is
What
can
an
interviewer
not
ask
That
is
what
details
about
the
employee
is
not
necessary
to
disclose
when
job
hunting
Well
in
most
cases
questions
can
t
escape
the
scope
of
what
is
relevant
to
the
position
you
are
applying
for
skills
and
employment
history
Outside
of
this
is
essentially
just
what
feels
correct
but
some
obvious
discussion
topics
that
should
be
omitted
are
questions
regarding
sexual
orientation
religious
affiliation
Interactions
with
the
law
in
the
past
such
as
arrests
that
don
t
result
in
an
actual
conviction
also
do
not
have
to
be
disclosed
If
still
in
the
application
process
an
employer
does
have
the
right
to
request
a
drug
test
Not
conforming
to
these
requests
will
most
certainly
lead
to
the
job
seeker
to
not
get
hired
After
being
hired
drug
tests
work
slightly
differently
In
most
cases
there
has
to
be
probable
cause
for
a
requested
drug
test
unless
your
job
has
an
already
indicated
requirement
for
random
drug
screenings
Another
common
question
is
Can
I
be
fired
without
reason
The
answer
to
this
is
complicated
and
changes
from
state
to
state
In
general
you
can
be
fired
for
any
reason
as
long
as
there
is
one
In
Texas
for
example
an
employer
has
the
right
to
fire
or
demote
an
employee
at
will
This
is
to
protect
a
business
interest
as
an
employee
s
wages
versus
work
become
unprofitable
the
company
can
fire
that
employee
without
repercussions
This
however
isn
t
true
if
you
feel
you
ve
been
discriminated
against
If
you
feel
like
you
ve
been
fired
for
an
invalid
reason
such
as
a
refusing
a
sexual
offer
from
a
coworker
or
refusing
to
work
off
the
clock
contact
a
Waco
personal
injury
attorney
immediately
You
have
rights
too
and
with
proper
representation
you
can
restore
those
rights
and
punish
those
that
abused
them

How
To
Go
About
Getting
The
Details
Of
A
Car
Accident
Resolved
Legal
Knowledge
Would
Be
Helpful
Posted
by
J
D
Lungren
For
context
this
happened
in
Oklahoma
I
was
in
a
car
accident
back
in
August
I
had
the
right
of
way
and
someone
in
the
oncoming
lane
failed
to
yield
and
turned
in
front
of
me
She
was
at
a
stop
at
the
green
light
why
I
don
t
know
and
I
was
going
30
thinking
she
was
yielding
As
I
crossed
through
the
intersection
she
turned
in
front
of
me
totaling
my
car
and
leaving
me
with
injuries
that
took
me
out
of
academic
work
and
a
sports
season
I
have
been
cleared
of
all
fault
by
the
police
Now
here
come
the
issues
I
hope
you
can
help
with
The
driver
of
the
vehicle
was
not
covered
by
the
car
owner
s
insurance
The
driver
was
an
unemployed
20
year
old
sister
to
the
owner
The
owner
had
an
up
to
date
insurance
card
although
she
had
canceled
her
insurance
So
therefore
she
had
no
insurance
at
the
time
of
the
accident
but
received
no
ticket
from
the
police
because
her
card
said
she
was
still
covered
After
the
incident
I
went
to
the
station
with
evidence
and
they
said
they
didn
t
feel
like
writing
her
a
ticket
so
they
won
t
Right
around
the
time
of
the
accident
the
owner
and
her
sisters
the
driver
being
one
of
them
moved
to
a
new
location
I
can
t
seem
to
find
out
where
I
have
found
many
addresses
for
her
but
they
are
either
all
old
or
false
I
had
to
go
to
the
doctor
6
times
over
head
injuries
Her
insurance
was
supposed
to
cover
it
But
of
course
with
no
insurance
there
s
no
money
to
cover
that
My
car
is
still
in
the
tow
yard
as
I
cannot
afford
to
get
it
out
It
s
racking
up
fees
daily
I
am
still
without
a
vehicle
as
mine
was
totaled
I
spoke
to
a
lawyer
and
she
said
suing
the
driver
would
be
useless
as
you
can
t
suck
blood
from
a
stone
Suing
the
owner
could
be
fruitful
as
she
works
for
the
casino
in
town
However
I
am
a
21
year
old
college
student
and
I
really
don
t
know
what
to
do
at
this
point
I
have
bills
from
the
accident
piling
up
that
I
have
yet
to
pay
I
don
t
want
to
go
through
the
process
of
suing
her
if
I
may
not
get
enough
money
back
to
make
it
worth
while
I
was
told
I
could
potentially
talk
to
her
in
person
to
see
if
I
could
settle
out
of
court
but
I
can
t
track
her
down
Anyone
with
legal
knowledge
or
have
been
in
a
similar
situation
please
help
me
out
I
want
to
get
this
resolved
as
soon
as
possible

about
a
month
ago

then
I
feel
so
comfortable
in

an

on
my

acetabular

I
feel
more
comfortable
in
my
5
inch
stiletto
pumps
than
my
flats
I
have
a
really
hard
time
in
flats
because
I
would
be
limping
when
I
walk
When
I
wear
my
stiletto
pumps
and
put
my
weight
onto
the
balls
of
my
feet
I
feel
so
much
more
comfortable

I
was
in
flats

Who
Else
Believes
That
Orton
Has
Failed
Wwe
s
Wellness
Policy
Posted
by
J
D
Lungren
I
do
not
believe
that
an
injury
is
the
reason
or
at
least
the
sole
reason
for
Orton
s
6
month
absence
He
has
been
jobbing
to
damn
near
everybody
for
the
past
two
months
an
I
got
very
suspicious
as
to
why
Super
Orton
was
losing
matches
regularly
I
believe
WWE
has
known
about
Orton
failing
a
drug
test
of
some
sort
and
decided
to
punish
him
for
it
get
other
superstars
over
by
having
him
job
to
them
getting
suspended
for
an
elongated
period
of
time
I
also
believe
in
anticipation
of
this
WWE
made
Sheamus
into
the
super
power
winning
machine
that
he
is
now
They
re
plan
was
to
have
Sheamus
win
everything
while
fading
Orton
from
being
as
unstoppable
as
he
once
was
Superstars
as
big
as
Orton
don
t
lost
frequently
without
reason
This
injury
is
a
cover
up
so
that
once
of
their
biggest
superstars
doesn
t
get
tainted

Way
Depressed
And
At
A
Loss
Right
Now
I
Need
Help
Posted
by
J
D
Lungren
I
m
apologizing
for
the
length
but
i
m
at
a
loss
here
sooo
Here
is
the
situation
I
am
currently
engaged
to
my
ex
boyfriend
s
best
friend
He
was
there
for
me
when
my
ex
wasn
t
and
was
sick
of
seeing
me
with
deadbeats
Well
here
I
am
a
month
later
with
a
whole
10
hrs
between
break
up
with
ex
and
accepting
engagement
i
think
I
am
pregnant
I
bought
a
test
tonight
going
to
take
it
tomorrow
BUT
it
would
be
my
ex
boyfriends
baby
My
fiance
understands
this
and
accepts
it
and
still
wants
me
to
let
my
ex
be
a
part
of
teh
baby
s
life
i
have
no
problem
with
that
The
other
part
of
this
my
fiance
adn
I
don
t
live
together
We
are
both
inbetween
jobs
I
had
a
severe
back
injury
and
am
still
rehabilitating
and
we
live
an
hour
apart
from
each
other
I
seriously
feel
like
he
is
hiding
something
from
me
His
ex
gf
texted
me
the
other
day
and
we
got
to
talking
well
she
thinks
she
is
preg
too
and
it
would
be
my
fiances
I
100
expect
him
to
be
a
part
of
that
child
s
life
Her
and
I
have
been
tag
teaming
and
catching
him
in
lies
For
some
reason
if
any
other
man
would
have
pulled
this
on
me
I
would
have
been
gone
a
long
time
ago
but
I
am
still
with
him
and
fighting
tooth
and
nail
to
make
it
work
I
don
t
care
if
he
his
friends
with
or
texts
or
hangs
out
with
other
girls
teh
part
that
bugs
me
is
that
he
is
a
major
flirt
and
doesn
t
let
me
know
when
he
is
with
them
and
will
ignore
me
when
i
try
to
get
ahold
of
him
Any
time
I
try
to
talk
to
him
about
HOW
I
FEEL
he
just
says
i
m
being
a
whiney
and
need
to
stop
because
i
have
nothing
to
worry
about
but
EVERYTHING
he
does
makes
me
suspicious
On
top
of
it
all
I
m
already
depressed
and
lately
its
just
been
worse
I
m
at
the
point
now
where
i
am
seriously
considering
checking
myself
into
a
mental
health
hospital
even
though
I
can
t
afford
it
I
am
sick
and
damn
tired
of
being
in
a
losing
battle
idfk
where
i
m
going
with
this
i
just
really
need
to
get
some
outside
opinions
If
I
end
up
breaking
it
off
with
him
I
will
raise
my
child
alone
Neither
man
will
be
a
part
of
their
life
because
honestly
I
think
its
for
the
best
that
they
are
in
a
calm
and
drama
free
environment
My
fiance
has
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
he
DOES
want
a
family
and
DOES
want
to
be
with
me
but
I
honestly
don
t
believe
him
If
he
truly
loved
me
and
cared
about
me
he
would
not
want
to
see
me
like
this
and
would
actually
LISTEN
to
me
instead
of
being
the
douchefuck
that
he
is
I
am
sick
and
damn
tired
of
spinning
my
wheels
This
may
sound
contradictory
but
I
am
a
fighter
I
will
never
give
up
but
at
the
same
time
I
won
t
beat
a
dead
horse
There
is
only
so
much
I
can
do
on
my
own
and
it
takes
us
BOTH
to
make
a
relationship

Am
I
In
A
Position
To
Commit
An
Assault
If
Need
Be
With
Minimal
Consequences
Posted
by
J
D
Lungren
State
is
Virginia
I
am
a
big
guy
6
4
250
pounds
muscular
I
have
boxing
and
martial
arts
experience
And
at
22
youth
is
on
my
side
I
know
that
for
most
people
crimes
will
severely
hinder
employment
in
the
future
However
I
have
no
job
I
drive
to
Atlantic
City
every
other
weekend
and
play
poker
professionally
I
made
69
000
last
year
And
I
didn
t
even
make
this
my
career
until
March
and
if
all
goes
according
to
my
current
averages
I
ll
break
6
figures
in
2012
I
have
a
nestegg
from
savings
plus
an
inheritence
that
would
last
me
at
least
5
years
so
if
I
go
a
few
months
without
making
money
it
won
t
be
a
problem
Therefore
I
have
no
need
for
a
job
and
there
s
no
one
to
fire
me
if
I
commit
an
assault
on
a
person
I
hate
So
I
can
commit
an
assault
without
losing
my
income
and
lifestyle
and
most
likely
the
other
person
cannot
And
that
also
means
the
victim
would
be
hard
pressed
to
collect
if
they
sued
me
Here
in
Virginia
all
the
civil
courts
ever
really
do
for
unpaid
judgements
is
to
garnish
my
wages
oh
wait
a
minute
Exactly
Who
s
going
to
garnish
me
the
casinos
So
lets
say
that
I
not
in
anyway
premeditated
but
I
get
into
an
argument
with
someone
and
get
pissed
and
decide
to
kick
their
No
serious
or
permanent
injuries
just
give
them
a
black
eye
or
two
and
maybe
a
bruised
rib
You
know
an
everyday
fight
One
sided
as
it
would
be
Having
no
criminal
history
what
am
I
likely
to
get
for
a
first
offence
of
knocking
someone
across
the
room
Would
it
be
safe
to
say
that
I
d
be
arrested
pay
my
bail
and
be
released
with
a
court
date
and
maybe
be
sentenced
to
probation
and
community
service
a
slap
on
the
wrist
that
would
make
the
whole
thing
worth
it
Afterall
the
career
hinderence
of
a
misdemeanor
conviction
is
usually
worse
that
the
court
punishment
and
again
I
don
t
have
a
boss
to
worry
about
Bearing
in
mind
that
affording
an
excellent
attorney
is
not
a
problem
for
me
by
the
way
Lol
I
could
see
myself
being
on
a
first
name
basis
with
my
usual
arresting
officer
and
be
like
Good
to
see
you
again

Dan

How
Does
One
Go
About
Finding
Pro
Bono
Doctors
Or
Hospitals
In
Colorado
Posted
by
J
D
Lungren
My
brother
was
in
a
motorcycle
accident
in
2006
He
didnt
have
any
insurance
and
so
a
lie
had
been
placed
on
his
medical
records
the
ER
did
not
know
that
he
had
just
been
in
an
accident
But
his
injuries
were
all
internal
He
had
a
compression
fracture
of
a
vertebrae
in
his
back
pretty
much
a
broken
back
and
they
did
other
tests
but
never
really
said
anything
else
was
wrong
He
was
sent
on
his
way
with
pain
medicine
and
said
that
they
couldnt
do
anything
for
the
broken
back
Well
he
suffered
from
so
many
injuries
its
hard
to
list
His
shoulder
is
completely
wacked
he
likely
broke
ribs
and
his
hips
were
messed
up
But
he
was
never
treated
He
never
got
insurance
and
never
took
care
of
himself
Through
the
last
couple
years
he
has
attempted
to
get
help
but
was
denied
medicare
He
has
been
to
doctors
and
he
thinks
they
dismiss
him
because
he
has
no
insurance
He
has
lost
so
much
weight
and
had
been
compensating
for
a
bad
back
that
everything
else
continued
to
be
out
of
wack
hips
knees
shoulder
ribs
etc
He
did
have
an
emergency
where
he
just
couldnt
walk
anymore
and
ended
up
getting
surgery
for
one
ruptured
disk
and
the
disk
above
and
below
were
not
ruptured
but
were
inflamed
He
somewhat
got
better
from
that
but
now
has
so
many
bills
its
not
even
funny
And
his
back
may
be
healed
but
the
rest
of
his
body
is
still
very
crippled
He
hasnt
been
able
to
work
He
has
been
in
such
chronic
severe
pain
that
he
is
hard
to
be
around
He
is
short
tempered
and
very
depressed
If
it
were
not
for
my
mother
he
would
be
homeless
actually
let
me
add
to
that
he
recently
had
conflicts
with
my
mother
and
is
not
staying
with
her
and
has
mooved
into
a
friends
house
who
has
younger
children
and
is
in
no
place
to
be
supporting
him
He
has
been
in
so
much
pain
that
he
has
not
been
able
to
work
He
does
not
get
workers
comp
As
I
said
before
he
cant
get
approved
for
medicare
He
is
so
thin
and
malnurished
that
he
is
constantly
cold
He
is
barely
skin
and
bones
and
looks
skeletal
Its
discusting
He
has
been
trying
to
get
out
and
find
a
job
but
it
has
been
too
cold
lately
and
he
says
he
has
a
hard
time
regulating
his
body
temperature
and
when
its
cold
its
just
not
worth
the
pain
to
move
from
the
house
He
says
it
takes
a
good
hour
of
stretching
each
morning
just
to
get
moving
But
now
he
tells
me
he
has
blood
in
his
stool
He
has
had
this
for
over
a
month
now
A
year
ago
he
had
a
bad
stomach
issue
where
he
was
throwing
up
and
had
such
pains
that
he
went
to
the
hospital
They
did
a
colonoskpy
and
removed
polyps
and
said
that
there
was
twisting
and
folds
in
his
colon
but
that
was
a
year
ago
So
today
I
dont
know
what
to
tell
him
He
tells
me
he
has
bright
red
blood
in
his
stool
but
he
has
no
doctor
to
go
to
and
the
er
is
likely
to
turn
him
away
saying
he
just
needs
to
see
a
doctor
He
has
no
income
and
is
in
so
much
pain
I
wish
there
was
some
kind
of
rehabilitation
hospital
for
him
to
go
to
They
could
do
other
surgery
to
fix
some
of
his
other
ailments
there
literally
is
a
bone
sticking
up
from
his
shoulder
and
he
does
not
have
full
movement
out
of
it
and
it
hurts
Im
sure
some
doctor
could
do
something
for
him
But
what
doctor
or
hospital
will
see
him
all
the
way
through
to
being
healthy
again
I
just
want
my
brother
back
He
used
to
ride
dirt
bikes
rock
climb
hike
camp
fish
play
paint
ball
go
hunting
but
none
of
that
now
He
stays
hunkered
up
in
a
basement
with
layers
of
clothes
on
and
hates
the
world
because
no
one
will
help
him
Is
there
some
hospital
in
Colorado
or
Doctor
that
takes
on
pro
bono
cases
or
something
Can
anyone
give
me
any
suggestions
on
how
to
help
I
am
out
of
state
and
just
want
to
help
my
brother
Thanks
in
advance
for
any
response
Feel
free
to
ask
questions
I
really
summed
up
his
issues
and
he
could
go
on
for
days
about
what
all
ailments
he
has
oh
yeah
like
his
bleeding
rotting
wisdom
teeth
that
need
to
be
removed
He
didnt
choose
to
be
homeless
insurance
less
job
less
he
is
in
so
much
pain
he
cant
get
a
job
to
get
the
insurance
and
then
once
he
may
get
insurance
he
is
not
likely
to
get
any
wages
because
he
is
in
so
much
debt
that
they
will
likely
garnish
his
wages
If
it
werent
for
family
and
this
one
friend
he
literally
would
be
just
like
the
local
homeless
guy
on
the
corner
That
scares
me
and
its
so
sad

How
Can
I
Change
This
Poem
Into
A
Story
Posted
by
J
D
Lungren
Tomorrow
I
have
two
hours
to
write
a
story
based
on
the
poem
below
I
have
come
up
with
something
like
she
has
a
crash
and
she
gets
rapid
short
memory
loss
so
when
she
wakes
up
in
the
mornIng
she
doesn
t
remember
that
her
dads
dead
and
stuff
Then
she
thinks
her
life
Is
worthless
and
try
s
to
commit
suicide
but
ends
up
in
hospital
When
she
wakes
up
she
can
remember
little
things
but
no
much
her
short
term
memory
loss
has
decreased
a
bit
Next
people
help
her
and
she
gets
her
memory
back
and
her
life
on
track
Then
she
s
in
another
crah
and
she
dies
How
can
I
make
this
better
and
more
interesting
Also
even
though
it
s
not
a
serious
exam
I
want
at
least
a
B
grade
How
can
I
archive
that
thanks
Case
history
Alison
head
injury
I
would
have
like
to
have
known
my
husbands
wife
my
mothers
only
daughter
A
bright
girl
she
was
Enmeshed
in
comforting
Fat
I
wonder
at
her
delicate
ankles
Her
autocratic
knee
Like
a
degas
dancers
Adjusts
to
the
observer
with
airy
poise
That
now
lugs
me
upstairs
Hardly
her
face
broken
By
nothing
sharper
then
smiles
holds
in
it
s
smiles
What
I
have
forgotten
She
knows
my
fathers
dead
and
grieves
for
it
and
smiles
She
has
digested
mourning
Her
smile
shows
it
I
who
need
reminding
every
morning
Shall
never
get
over
What
I
do
not
remember
Consistency
matters
I
should
like
to
keep
faith
with
her
lack
of
faith
But
forget
her
reasons
Proud
of
this
younger
self
I
assert
her
Achivements
her
A
levels
Her
job
for
the
future
Poor
clever
girl
I
know
For
all
my
damaged
brain
something
she
doesn

I
am
her
future

What
Is
The
Point
To
My
Life
Posted
by
J
D
Lungren
I
an
13
and
I
just
recently
moved
to
a
new
school
My
dad
lost
his
job
in
my
old
town
and
got
one
10
hours
away
I
am
good
at
one
thing
an
that
is
soccer
but
when
I
moved
here
I
found
out
that
there
isn
t
a
soccer
team
within
miles
of
this
awful
place
It
is
a
college
town
of
only
3000
ppl
My
dad
took
the
only
thing
that
I
loved
away
from
me
He
is
a
golf
pro
so
he
expects
me
to
play
I
have
a
horse
but
nobody
teaches
my
style
of
riding
They
took
everything
from
me
when
we
moved
I
went
to
school
and
found
out
nobody
wanted
me
there
Within
days
there
were
rumors
I
didn
t
say
anything
I
just

My
mom
doesn

care
for
me
she
never
tells
me
she
loves
me
she
cringes
when
I
give
her
a
hug
It
s
obvious
tht
she
doesn
t
want
me
and
that
I
was
a
mistake
We
argue
constantly
Nobody
wants
me
I
hate
ppl
now

these
people
I
don

understand
what

keeping
me
here
I
would
rather
die
I
went
to
a
catholic
school
I
pray
and
god
doesn

answer
I
cry
constantly
I
don

understand
what

here
I
guess
it
s
death
But
I
know
I
would
never

How
Can
I
Change
This
Poem
Into
A
Story
Posted
by
J
D
Lungren
Tomorrow
I
have
two
hours
to
write
a
story
based
on
the
poem
below
I
have
come
up
with
something
like
she
has
a
crash
and
she
gets
rapid
short
memory
loss
so
when
she
wakes
up
in
the
mornIng
she
doesn
t
remember
that
her
dads
dead
and
stuff
Then
she
thinks
her
life
Is
worthless
and
try
s
to
commit
suicide
but
ends
up
in
hospital
When
she
wakes
up
she
can
remember
little
things
but
no
much
her
short
term
memory
loss
has
decreased
a
bit
Next
people
help
her
and
she
gets
her
memory
back
and
her
life
on
track
Then
she
s
in
another
crah
and
she
dies
How
can
I
make
this
better
and
more
interesting
Also
even
though
it
s
not
a
serious
exam
I
want
at
least
a
B
grade
How
can
I
archive
that
thanks
Case
history
Alison
head
injury
I
would
have
like
to
have
known
my
husbands
wife
my
mothers
only
daughter
A
bright
girl
she
was
Enmeshed
in
comforting
Fat
I
wonder
at
her
delicate
ankles
Her
autocratic
knee
Like
a
degas
dancers
Adjusts
to
the
observer
with
airy
poise
That
now
lugs
me
upstairs
Hardly
her
face
broken
By
nothing
sharper
then
smiles
holds
in
it
s
smiles
What
I
have
forgotten
She
knows
my
fathers
dead
and
grieves
for
it
and
smiles
She
has
digested
mourning
Her
smile
shows
it
I
who
need
reminding
every
morning
Shall
never
get
over
What
I
do
not
remember
Consistency
matters
I
should
like
to
keep
faith
with
her
lack
of
faith
But
forget
her
reasons
Proud
of
this
younger
self
I
assert
her
Achivements
her
A
levels
Her
job
for
the
future
Poor
clever
girl
I
know
For
all
my
damaged
brain
something
she
doesn
t
I
am
her
future

How
Does
One
Go
About
Finding
Pro
Bono
Doctors
Or
Hospitals
In
Colorado
Posted
by
J
D
Lungren
My
brother
was
in
a
motorcycle
accident
in
2006
He
didnt
have
any
insurance
and
so
a
lie
had
been
placed
on
his
medical
records
the
ER
did
not
know
that
he
had
just
been
in
an
accident
But
his
injuries
were
all
internal
He
had
a
compression
fracture
of
a
vertebrae
in
his
back
pretty
much
a
broken
back
and
they
did
other
tests
but
never
really
said
anything
else
was
wrong
He
was
sent
on
his
way
with
pain
medicine
and
said
that
they
couldnt
do
anything
for
the
broken
back
Well
he
suffered
from
so
many
injuries
its
hard
to
list
His
shoulder
is
completely
wacked
he
likely
broke
ribs
and
his
hips
were
messed
up
But
he
was
never
treated
He
never
got
insurance
and
never
took
care
of
himself
Through
the
last
couple
years
he
has
attempted
to
get
help
but
was
denied
medicare
He
has
been
to
doctors
and
he
thinks
they
dismiss
him
because
he
has
no
insurance
He
has
lost
so
much
weight
and
had
been
compensating
for
a
bad
back
that
everything
else
continued
to
be
out
of
wack
hips
knees
shoulder
ribs
etc
He
did
have
an
emergency
where
he
just
couldnt
walk
anymore
and
ended
up
getting
surgery
for
one
ruptured
disk
and
the
disk
above
and
below
were
not
ruptured
but
were
inflamed
He
somewhat
got
better
from
that
but
now
has
so
many
bills
its
not
even
funny
And
his
back
may
be
healed
but
the
rest
of
his
body
is
still
very
crippled
He
hasnt
been
able
to
work
He
has
been
in
such
chronic
severe
pain
that
he
is
hard
to
be
around
He
is
short
tempered
and
very
depressed
If
it
were
not
for
my
mother
he
would
be
homeless
actually
let
me
add
to
that
he
recently
had
conflicts
with
my
mother
and
is
not
staying
with
her
and
has
mooved
into
a
friends
house
who
has
younger
children
and
is
in
no
place
to
be
supporting
him
He
has
been
in
so
much
pain
that
he
has
not
been
able
to
work
He
does
not
get
workers
comp
As
I
said
before
he
cant
get
approved
for
medicare
He
is
so
thin
and
malnurished
that
he
is
constantly
cold
He
is
barely
skin
and
bones
and
looks
skeletal
Its
discusting
He
has
been
trying
to
get
out
and
find
a
job
but
it
has
been
too
cold
lately
and
he
says
he
has
a
hard
time
regulating
his
body
temperature
and
when
its
cold
its
just
not
worth
the
pain
to
move
from
the
house
He
says
it
takes
a
good
hour
of
stretching
each
morning
just
to
get
moving
But
now
he
tells
me
he
has
blood
in
his
stool
He
has
had
this
for
over
a
month
now
A
year
ago
he
had
a
bad
stomach
issue
where
he
was
throwing
up
and
had
such
pains
that
he
went
to
the
hospital
They
did
a
colonoskpy
and
removed
polyps
and
said
that
there
was
twisting
and
folds
in
his
colon
but
that
was
a
year
ago
So
today
I
dont
know
what
to
tell
him
He
tells
me
he
has
bright
red
blood
in
his
stool
but
he
has
no
doctor
to
go
to
and
the
er
is
likely
to
turn
him
away
saying
he
just
needs
to
see
a
doctor
He
has
no
income
and
is
in
so
much
pain
I
wish
there
was
some
kind
of
rehabilitation
hospital
for
him
to
go
to
They
could
do
other
surgery
to
fix
some
of
his
other
ailments
there
literally
is
a
bone
sticking
up
from
his
shoulder
and
he
does
not
have
full
movement
out
of
it
and
it
hurts
Im
sure
some
doctor
could
do
something
for
him
But
what
doctor
or
hospital
will
see
him
all
the
way
through
to
being
healthy
again
I
just
want
my
brother
back
He
used
to
ride
dirt
bikes
rock
climb
hike
camp
fish
play
paint
ball
go
hunting
but
none
of
that
now
He
stays
hunkered
up
in
a
basement
with
layers
of
clothes
on
and
hates
the
world
because
no
one
will
help
him
Is
there
some
hospital
in
Colorado
or
Doctor
that
takes
on
pro
bono
cases
or
something
Can
anyone
give
me
any
suggestions
on
how
to
help
I
am
out
of
state
and
just
want
to
help
my
brother
Thanks
in
advance
for
any
response
Feel
free
to
ask
questions
I
really
summed
up
his
issues
and
he
could
go
on
for
days
about
what
all
ailments
he
has
oh
yeah
like
his
bleeding
rotting
wisdom
teeth
that
need
to
be
removed
He
didnt
choose
to
be
homeless
insurance
less
job
less
he
is
in
so
much
pain
he
cant
get
a
job
to
get
the
insurance
and
then
once
he
may
get
insurance
he
is
not
likely
to
get
any
wages
because
he
is
in
so
much
debt
that
they
will
likely
garnish
his
wages
If
it
werent
for
family
and
this
one
friend
he
literally
would
be
just
like
the
local
homeless
guy
on
the
corner
That
scares
me
and
its
so
sad

a
year
ago
So
today
I
dont
know
what
to
tell
him
He
tells
me
he
has
bright
red
blood
in
his
stool
but
he
has
no
doctor
to
go
to
and
the
er
is
likely
to
turn
him
away
saying
he
just
needs
to
see
a
doctor
He
has
no
income
and
is
in
so
much
pain
I
wish
there
was
some
kind
of
rehabilitation
hospital
for
him
to
go
to
They
could
do
other
surgery
to
fix
some
of
his
other
ailments
there
literally
is
a
bone
sticking
up
from
his
shoulder
and
he
does
not
have
full
movement
out
of
it
and
it
hurts
Im
sure
some
doctor
could
do
something
for
him
But
what
doctor
or
hospital
will
see
him
all
the
way
through
to
being
healthy
again
I
just
want
my
brother
back
He
used
to
ride
dirt
bikes
rock
climb
hike
camp
fish
play
paint
ball
go
hunting
but
none
of
that
now
He
stays
hunkered
up
in
a
basement
with
layers
of
clothes
on
and
hates
the
world
because
no
one
will
help
him
Is
there
some
hospital
in
Colorado
or
Doctor
that
takes
on
pro
bono
cases
or
something
Can
anyone
give
me
any
suggestions
on
how
to
help
I
am
out
of
state
and
just
want
to
help
my
brother
Thanks
in
advance
for
any
response
Feel
free
to
ask
questions
I
really
summed
up
his
issues
and
he
could
go
on
for
days
about
what
all
ailments
he
has
oh
yeah
like
his
bleeding
rotting
wisdom
teeth
that
need
to
be
removed
He
didnt
choose
to
be
homeless
insurance
less
job
less
he
is
in
so
much
pain
he
cant
get
a
job
to
get
the
insurance
and
then
once
he
may
get
insurance
he
is
not
likely
to
get
any
wages
because
he
is
in
so
much
debt
that
they
will
likely
garnish
his
wages
If
it
werent
for
family
and
this
one
friend
he
literally
would
be
just
like
the
local
homeless
guy
on
the
corner
That
scares
me
and
its
so
sad

Badly

Dysfunctional
relationship
your
opinion
Do
you
perceive
any
real
love
dedication
in
this
marriage
They
are
the
strangest
couples
i
have
ever
come
across
Husband
31
and
is
famous
and
very
wealthy
i
mean
this
guy
ever
since
he
started
dating
this
woman
had
been
repeatedly
cheating
on
her
sometimes
harassing
female
co
workers
sexually
getting
infatuated
with
other
ladies
going
on
dates
with
other
women
making
semi
nude
women
sit
on
his
lap
and
he
always
got
himself
photographed
while
doing
all
this
even
after
marriage
hes
been
caught
cheating
with
a
fellow
co
worker
and
a
friend
he
used
to
do
drugs
and
stopped
breathing
and
the
fiance
called
the
ambulance
But
then
why
is
he
cheating
always
and
how
come
shes
always
unperturbed
by
it
She
spends
her
days
getting
photographed
with
her
friends
clearly
showing
no
concern
enjoying
his
fame
luxury
and
status
who
blatantly
posts
pictures
of
herself
and
her
dozen
girl
friends
in
bars
restaurants
bedrooms
stadiums
beach
all
over
social
networking
sites
and
is
least
bothered
about
what
he
does
always
clicking
her
pictures
in
weird
postures
she
doesn
t
even
spend
much
time
with
her
child
and
spend
s
her
time
getting
photographed
with
her
friends
The
husband
openly
thrashed
the
fellow
co
worker
one
of
his
best
friends
her
publicly
on
radio
for
being
a
and
the
10
men
he
knows
she
slept
with
and
who
she
must
be
sleeping
with
while
hes
talking
mentioning
wife
saying
what
he
put
her
through
when
stopped
breathing
after
he
overdosed
on
drugs
6
years
ago
and
the
wife
has
no
effect
when
he
did
drugs
6
years
ago
she
did
nothing
to
help
him
no
rehab
no
counseling
only
dressing
up
dainty
and
coming
to
events
with
him
as
normally
people
would
do
instead
when
he
overdosed
and
stopped
breathing
then
she
called
the
ambulance
what
the
heck
BUT
when
she
went
to
watch
him
perform
she
moved
away
from
him
the
moment
she
saw
him
coming
near
her
even
though
he
wasn
t
even
coming
towards
her
she
said
something
and
moved
away
immediately
HOW
CAN
A
WIFE
SHIFT
AWAY
AT
THE
SIGHT
OF
HER
OWN
HUSBAND
They
kiss
in
the
crowds
only
when
the
husband
can
and
when
lots
of
people
see
otherwise
the
woman
sits
backstage
And
he
keeps
lying
on
twitter
about
what
a
family
man
he
is
And
then
on
twitter
he
keeps
saying
things
about
her
like
shes
back
on
twitter
as
people
had
said
horrible
things
to
her
calling
her
a
gold
digger
so
she
left
showing
her
photo
with
her
friends
on
twitter
that
she
went
to
a
Saturday
night
show
saying
happy
birthday
to
me
on
twitter
when
we
live
together
time
needed
to
be
with
family
after
he
took
a
break
from
work
everything
on
twitter
Like
spreading
news
that
they
are
going
to
Bahamas
for
a
family
vacation
when
he
took
a
break
three
weeks
ago
On

Jan

they
were

birthday
instead
wrote

birthday
to
her
on
his
account
on
twitter
when
they

together
the
only
thing
he
does
is

heist
Film
Title
Where
what
was
the
70
s
or
maybe
early
80
s
bank
heist
FILM
TITLE
in
which
for
the
ending
scene
the
movie
showed
one
of
the
main
characters
who
had
succeeded
in
accomplishing
with
5
or
6
fellow
accomplices
what
seemed
to
be
an
almost
impossible
bank
robbery
they
did
it
by
dodging
around
a
complex
grid
pattern
of
security
system
infra
red
light
beams
and
now
for
the
ending
this
main
character
is
shown
supposedly
10
or
15
years
later
visiting
one
of
his
now
very
wealthy
fellow
accomplice
s
office
Our
main
character
is
then
shown
in
to
the
fellow
accomplice

Treatment
of
epithelioid
mesothelioma
Posted
by
Timothy
Allageri
Treatment
of
epithelioid
mesothelioma
Epithelioid
mesothelioma
is
the
most
common
cell
type
that
is
relatively
uniform
in
shape
and
has
a
tubular
pattern
with
a
distinct
cell
nucleus
Epithelioid
is
the
most
common
kind
50
70
cases
reported
are
of
this
type
which
also
has
the
best
possibility
of
survival
This
type
affects
the
covering
surrounding
the
internal
organs
and
internal
surfaces
in
the
body
In
spite
of
various
new
treatment
options
the
survival
rate
of
Mesothelioma
disease
is
low
These
options
have
helped
in
increasing
the
longevity
of
mesothelioma
patients
Statistics
indicate
that
the
average
survival
period
after
diagnosis
is
about
one
year
The
survival
period
might
increase
up
to
two
years
if
the
proper
treatment
is
done
aggressively
More
than
95
cases
with
mesothelioma
disease
occur
due
to
asbestos
exposure
Epithelium
is
a
tissue
separating
different
regions
of
the
body
Like
in
the
case
of
epithelial
cells
found
in
the
skin
detaches
the
outside
of
the
body
from
the
inside
of
the
body
This
serves
varied
responsibilities
like
protection
absorption
filtration
excretion
secretion
or
sensory
reception

Understanding
Mesothelioma
How
To
Win
Your
Claim
Mesothelioma
is
a
grave
and
uncommon
sickness
caused
by
sustained
and
persistent
exposure
and
breathing
in
of
the
asbestos
fibers
rampantly
used
in
most
industries
till
early
1980s
It
is
the
cancer
of
the
Mesothelioma
layer
a
protective
sac
that
encloses
some
major
organs
in
the
human
body
The
Calamity
Sadly
the
fact
remains
that
the
disease
of
Mesothelioma
is
diagnosed
only
in
the
final
stages
and
remains
incurable
at
that
time
The
fat
is
further
psychologically
worsened
by
the
fact
that
it
was
caused
by
pure
carelessness
and
avoiding
using
proper
preventive
covering
and
precautions
The
risk
has
been
made
evident
by
research
since
the
1920s
but
the
corporations
that
had
the
risk
never
encouraged
use
of
these
precautions
These
facts
bring
to
light
a
simple
hope
of
compensation
that
a
victim
could
be
eligible
for
in
the
darkness
of
this
disease
that
ends
in
death

A
brief
review
on
types
of
mesothelioma
Posted

Timothy
Allageri
A
brief
review
on
types
of
mesothelioma
Mesothelioma
has
emerged
as
a
fatal
disease
only
in
the
recent
years
It
is
a
form
of
cancer
and
usually
presents
itself
in
malignant
form
and
results
in
forming
tumours
in
or
around
the
important
organs
of
the
body
The
mesothelium
is
the
lining
that
protects
the
internal
organs
of
the
body
Mesothelioma
causes
this
lining
to
become
malignant
and
grow
deadly
for
the
patient
if
not
diagnosed
in
its
earliest
stages
We
know
from
medical
experimentation
that
mesothelioma
is
caused
by
the
patient
being
exposed
to
excessive
amounts
of
asbestos
and
it
can
be
of
three
types
pleural
peritoneal
or
pericardial
Each
of
the
types
has
specific
symptoms
and
there
are
some
symptoms
that
are
common
to
all
three
However
in
all
cases
the
patient
rarely
realizes
that
he
is
suffering
from
mesothelioma
till
many
years
after
he
has
contracted
the
malignance
The
most
common
type
of
mesothelioma
is
pleural
mesothelioma
In
this
case
the
lungs
are
affected
and
the
lining
of
the
lungs
as
well
as
its
cavity
might
become
malignant
The
symptoms
in
this
case
include
the
congestion
of
fluid
in
between
the
lung
lining
and
the
chest
cavity
problems
in
breathing
difficulty
in
swallowing
food
or
liquids
shortness
of
breath
lasting
stretches
of
coughing
excessive
weight
loss
persistent
fever
occasional
coughing
up
of
blood
as
well
as
rasping
A
rarer
type
of
the
disease
is
peritoneal
mesothelioma
In
this
case
the
abdomen
or
the
stomach
is
affected
In
this
type
of
mesothelioma
the
cancer
can
occur
in
areas
of
the
abdomen
but
gradually
spread
throughout
the
body
Tumours
grow
along
the
wall
of
the
stomach
and
cause
many
of
the
following
symptoms
pains
in
the
abdomen
swelling
in
the
stomach
feeling
of
nausea
loss
in
appetite
problems
in
breathing
bowel
obstruction
fever
vomiting
pains
in
the
chest
region
anaemia
and
other
abnormalities
of
blood
clotting
The
rarest
form
of
mesothelioma
is
pericardial
mesothelioma
In
this
case
the
heart
and
its
surrounding
or
inner
parts
are
affected
by
the
cancer
In
pericardial
mesothelioma
the
patient
might
experience
chest
pain
breathing
problems
including
shortness
of
breath
palpitation
in
the
heart
as
well
as
persistent
coughing

Pericardial
Mesothelioma
Quick
Facts
Posted
by
Timothy
Allageri
What
is
pericardial
mesothelioma
It
is
a
cancer
caused
by
the
inhalation
of
asbestos
dust
and
is
the
most
rare
of
mesothelioma
cancers
It
accounts
for
about
5
of
all
cases
Its
period
of
latency
time
it
takes
for
the
symptoms
to
show
is
approximately
30
50
years
Symptoms
are
similar
to
other
diseases
such
as
pneumonia
whilst
in
the
early
stages
This
makes
it
rather
difficult
to
diagnose
and
treat
What
are
the
treatment
options
for
pericardial
mesothelioma
There
are
three
options
available
for
an
individual
diagnosed
with
this
cancer
surgery
radiation
and
chemotherapy
A
patient
will
first
require
a
doctor
s
evaluation
to
determine
which
treatment
option
is
suitable
for
him

Mesothelioma
Treatments
Some
Basic
Facts
Posted
by
Timothy
Allageri
Before
we
discuss
about
mesothelioma
treatments
it
is
important
to
have
an
understanding
of
what
is
mesothelioma
Mesothelioma
is
a
rare
cancer
of
the
linings
of
lungs
and
abdominal
area
caused
by
exposure
to
asbestos
fibers
It
takes
30
40
years
for
this
cancer
to
appear
after
the
asbestos
exposure
It
is
important
to
treat
this
cancer
in
the
early
stages
otherwise
it
proves
fatal
Various
mesothelioma
treatments
are
surgery
chemotherapy
and
radiation
therapy
There
are
two
types
of
surgeries
for
mesothelioma
treatments
Aggressive
Surgery
and
Palliative
Procedures
Before
performing
any
surgery
it
is
necessary
to
check
whether
the
heart
and
lungs
are
functioning
properly
Of
the
two
types
aggressive
surgery
also
known
as
Pneumonectomy
is
complicated
surgery
performed
on
younger
patients
who
are
good
in
health
and
can
bear
the
surgery
Pneumonectomy
involves
the
removal
of
extra
pleural
membrane
The
main
purpose
of
this
mesothelioma
treatment
is
to
physically
remove
as
much
tumor
as
possible
Palliative
procedures
of
mesothelioma
treatment
are
known
as
Pleurectomy
It
is
done
in
the
early
stages
of
cancer
This
process
of
mesothelioma
treatment
involves
surgical
removal
of
pleura
However
the
procedures
are
involved
to
lessen
and
control
the
symptoms
rather
than
to
cure
the
disease
This
surgery
reduces
the
pain
caused
by
the
tumor
mass
and
helps
in
preventing
the
recurrence
of
pleural
effusion
Complete
removal
of
tumor
is
not
possible
with
this
procedure

Mesothelioma
Statistics
An
Eye
opener
Posted
by
Timothy
Allageri
Mesothelioma
statistics
are
data
about
mesothelioma
a
dangerous
cancer
that
affects
the
lining
of
the
lungs
and
the
abdomen
In
some
cases
mesothelioma
can
affect
the
heart
and
reproductive
organs
too
It
is
a
fatal
disease
with
patients
surviving
for
only
one
two
years
after
the
diagnosis
What
have
Mesothelioma
Statistics
Revealed
Mesothelioma
statistics
have
revealed
that
nearly
seventy
to
eighty
per
cent
of
all
cases
of
mesothelioma
have
been
directly
traced
to
prolonged
exposure
to
asbestos
Asbestos
was
a
frequently
used
material
in
construction
railroad
factory
shipyard
and
automobile
industries
Mesothelioma
statistics
were
able
to
highlight
the
link
between
asbestos
and
cancer
nearly
sixty
years
ago
However
unscrupulous
industries
have
chosen
to
continue
using
asbestos
for
profit
motives
Mesothelioma
statistics
also
portray
mesothelioma
to
be
a
silent
killer
This
is
because
the
disease
lies
dormant
in
the
body
for
periods
between
ten
to
fifty
years
It
is
usually
diagnosed
in
patients
when
they
are
between
fifty
and
seventy
years
of
age
Normally
the
diagnosis
of
mesothelioma
is
only
after
the
case
has
reached
the
last
stage
and
there
is
very
little
hope
for
the
survival
of
the
patient

Mesothelioma
Prognosis
The
Science
of
Saving
Lives
Posted
by
Timothy
Allageri
A
whopping
2
000
to
3
000
new
cases
of
mesothelioma
is
on
the
rise
in
United
States
of
America
Mesothelioma
is
a
rare
form
of
cancer
and
it
is
an
aftereffect
of
the
asbestos
exposure
The
cancerous
cells
tend
to
destroy
the
mesothelium
which
is
a
protective
sac
that
holds
the
internal
organs
of
the
body
Initially
pleura
or
peritoneum
are
affected
and
then
it
spreads
to
the
other
parts
of
the
body
It
is
a
fatal
disease
and
the
survival
time
of
the
victim
is
almost
one
year
from
the
time
of
diagnosis
depending
on
the
treatment
and
other
contributing
factors
What
is
mesothelioma
prognosis
Prognosis
for
mesothelioma
is
solely
dependent
on
the
merit
of
diagnosis
and
the
treatment
If
treatment
is
provided
with
much
delay
then
the
survival
chance
of
the
victim
grows
slimmer
Then
again
survivability
depends
heavily
on
factors
like
treatment
type
of
mesothelioma
as
well
as
patients
health
and
morale
The
stage
of
the
disease
during
diagnosis
is
the
most
crucial
factor
that
decides
the
prognosis
and
the
minimum
survival
expectancy
of
the
victim
But
disappointingly
mesothelioma
unlike
other
cancers
is
somewhat
difficult
to
stage
This
is
because
the
symptoms
of
mesothelioma
are
non
specific
due
to
which
the
cells
are
already
matured
at
the
time
of
diagnosis

What
is
Cancer
Cancer
is
the
term
used
to
describe
uncontrolled
cell
growth
Cancer
can
strike
almost
anywhere
in
the
human
body
because
every
part
and
every
organ
is
made
from
millions
of
cells
The
division
and
development
of
cells
is
an
extremely
delicate
procedure
and
any
interruption
in
the
process
can
cause
an
abnormal
level
of
cell
growth
If
the
growth
becomes
very
large
it
is
called
a
tumour
Benign
and
malignant
are
the
two
types
of
cancerous
tumours
The
benign
type
is
safe
and
does
not
cause
harm
to
the
patient
or
spread
and
they
can
easily
be
removed
Malignant
tumours
are
often
serious
and
can
spread
to
other
organs
and
body
parts
and
if
left
untreated
are
generally
fatal
The
malignant
type
is
what
the
term
cancer
generally
refers

Whenever
one
hears
about
Cancer
Treatments
they
immediately
think
of
the
words
chemotherapy
and
radiation
It
is
unknown
to
most
how
a
cancer
patient
s
treatment
is
specifically
determined
Patients
do
not
know
when
will
one
receive
chemotherapy
or
radiation
treatments
or
maybe
both
and
when
one
will
undergo
surgery
or
maybe
none
of
the
above
as
they
will
be
introduced
to
additional
treatment
options
Firstly
it
should
be
known
that
each
cancer
patient
receives
a
personal
tailored
treatment
plan
according
to
his
or
her
cancerous
tumor
When
an
oncologist
approaches
a
patient
in
order
to
start
planning
his
treatment
regime
we
will
look
in
to
a
few
different
factors
including
the
location
of
the
cancer
the
stage
of
the
cancer
has
it
spread
to
other
organs
the
size
of
the
growth
and
the
specific
type
of
the
disease
In
some
cases
the
oncologist
may
also
take
into
consideration
the
age
and
general
health
of
the
patient
and
in
women
the
doctor
can
take
into
consideration
future
procreation
preferences
Once
all
this
is
known
the
oncologist
will
design
a
treatment
plan
designated
for
the
patient

Mesothelioma
Cancer
The
Deadly
Disease
Mesothelioma
Answers
Posted
by
As
the
old
proverb
goes
health
is
equivalent
to
wealth
In
the
modern
world
often
individuals
are
not
able
to
take
out
time
from
their
busy
schedules
and
take
care
of
their
health
Nowadays
people
have
started
to
ignore
their
health
and
take
it
for
granted
Thus
they
end
up
paying
very
heavy
price
in
future
It
is
necessary
to
take
proper
measures
when
people
know
that
they
are
prone
to
so
many
deadly
diseases
One
of
such
diseases
is
Mesothelioma
It
affects
membrane
and
is
a
type
of
cancer
Mesothelium
affects
all
main
body
parts
If
you
inhale
asbestos
fibers
then
the
chances
of
you
contracting
the
disease
increases
It
will
be
difficult
to
detect
the
disease
in
the
initial
stage
by
just
looking
at
a
person
s
health
It
actually
takes
around
25
to
30
years
for
a
person
to
know
that
he
or
she
is
suffering
from
this
deadly
disease
The
initial
symptoms
of
Mesothelioma
cancer
are
mostly
similar
to
normal
conditions
of
health
Diagnosing
mesothelioma
cancer
is
one
of
the
difficult
tasks
even
for
professional
doctors
The
main
symptoms
are
swelling
and
pain
in
abdomen
weight
loss
loss
in
appetite
nausea
and
overall
weakness
in
the
body
Worst
part
is
that
fluid
fills
the
cavity
in
the
abdominal
walls
and
thus
the
chances
of
tumor
growing
inside
the
abdomen
increases
which
is
a
bad
sign

Stages
of
Mesothelioma
Posted
by
Studies
reveal
that
every
year
more
than
100
000
men
are
diagnosed
with
prostate
cancer
The
disease
results
because
of
the
abnormal
and
uncontrollable
division
of
cells
in
the
prostate
gland
The
severity
of
the
cancer
depends
on
the
rate
of
the
growth
of
these
cells
Prostate
cancer
is
common
among
men
more
than
45
years
of
age
Chances
of
being
afflicted
by
this
condition
greatly
arise
if
there
is
a
family
history
of
the
prostate
cancer
So
if
an
immediate
predecessor
father
or
brother
was
diagnosed
with
prostate
cancer
the
chances
of
developing
this
condition
increase
significantly
as
a
result
of
the
mutation
in
the
gene
BRCA2
faulty
BRCA2
gene
Common
symptoms
include
enlargement
of
the
prostate
gland
which
in
turn
constricts
the
urethra
and
affects
the
passage
of
urine
from
the
body
The
colour
of
the
urine
changes
from
normal
to
darker
yellow
and
reddish
yellow
There
may
also
be
blood
in
urine
and
semen
The
patient
may
also
feel
pain
in
the
back
pelvis
thighs
hips
and
ribs

early
detection
Men

should
speak
to
their

about

Reaching

According
to

we

renaissance
His
piece
as
the
cover
story
in
Time
Magazine
deals
not
only
with
chronic
pain
but
with
the
way
that
chronic
pain
is
perceived
by
physicians
around
the
globe
As
The

Center
took
on
the
critical
relationship
between
a
patient
and
pain
physician
with
the
latest
Pain
Channel
episode
Time
Magazine
and
Dr
Oz
were
working
up
an
entire
Health
Special
on
Chronic
Pain
What
Dr
Oz
calls
a
pain
renaissance
we
at
The
Pain
Center
have
been
experiencing
for
years
Chronic
pain
is
not
just
about
your
bad
back
or
arthritic
knee
People
with
chronic
pain
are
twice
as
likely
to
suffer
from
depression
and
anxiety
as
those
without
If
pain
affects
body
mind
and

then
treatment
must

these
three
pillars
of
the
human

Ongoing
research
in
colorectal
disease
Asbestos
Abatement
Posted
by
Dr
Eric
Haas
Houston
colon
surgeon
is
committed
to
furthering
research
in
colorectal
disease
There
are
currently
six
studies
that
Dr
Eric
Haas
is
involved
in
Comparison
of
outcomes
between
robotic
assisted
laparoscopic
surgery
and
conventional
laparoscopic
surgery
for
colorectal
disease
Several
studies
have
shown
that
new
surgical
techniques
have
the
potential
of
improving
outcomes
following
colorectal
surgery
Robotic
assisted
laparoscopic
surgery
has
emerged
as
a
viable
option
for
colorectal
procedures
offering
various
visual
and
operative
advantages
The
purpose
of
the
this
study
is
to
compare
short
term
and
pathology
outcomes
in
patients
that
undergo
colorectal
surgery
either
with
robotic
assisted
laparoscopic
surgery
or
conventional
laparoscopic
surgery
This
study
involves
gathering
anonymous
data
from
patient
records
in
order
to
compare
and
evaluate
the
efficacy
of
this
new
surgical
approach
with
an
established
surgical
technique
Comparison
of
outcomes
between
single
site
laparoscopic
surgery
and
conventional
laparoscopic
surgery
for
colectomy
Single
site
or
single
incision
laparoscopic
surgery
offers
many
potential
advantages
for
the
surgical
treatment
of
colorectal
diseases
This
minimally
invasive
laparoscopic
technique
is
performed
entirely
through
the
umbilicus
and
results
in
minimal
scar
with
diminished
pain
This
trial
will
compare
the
clinical
outcomes
of
single
site
laparoscopic
surgery
with
those
obtained
through
conventional
laparoscopic
surgery
of
the
colon
and
rectum
Assessment
of
quality
of
life
QOL
following
minimally
invasive
colorectal
surgery
Minimally
invasive
surgery
has
emerged
as
a
viable
option
for
the
treatment
of
benign
and
malignant
colorectal
disease
Comparisons
of
intra
operative
results
and
post
operative
outcomes
have
been
well
documented
in
the
literature
While
comparisons
between
laparoscopic
and
open
surgery
are
well
reported
there
are
few
if
any
reports
of
comparisons
between
the
different
types
of
minimally
invasive
surgery
e
g
conventional
hand
assisted
single
incision
or
robotic
assisted
laparoscopic
surgery
Short
and
long
term
outcomes
with
regard
to
quality
of
life
are
seldom
reported
following
any
surgical
procedure
The
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
assess
QOL
outcomes
through
completed
questionnaires
in
patients
undergoing
minimally
invasive
surgery
for
colorectal
disease

An
Insight
To
Asbestos
Lawsuits
Posted
by
Timothy
Allageri
The
phenomena
of
mesothelioma
cancer
is
a
global
challenge
After
decades
of
research
and
scientific
analysis
it
has
been
proven
without
any
doubt
that
exposure
to
asbestos
causes
this
deadly
disease
Cases
of
people
working
in
dangerous
environment
that
has
high
presence
of
asbestos
is
life
threatening
Exhaling
asbestos
fiber
for
long
periods
can
cause
various
forms
of
lung
cancer
Asbestos
is
an
important
silicate
mineral
and
till
the
70s
it
was
used
for
fireproofing
of
roofs
and
floors
They
are
also
heavily
used
on
off
shore
oil
production
platforms
and
rigs
However
exposure
to
this
item
for
long
periods
of
time
is
very
risky
and
can
result
in
death
as
well

Is
your
daily
diet
slowly
killing
you
Posted
by
Timothy
Allageri
Is
what
you
are
eating
everyday
affecting
your
health
Is
your
daily
diet
extending
your
life
or
shortening
your
life
The
answer
is
either
yes
or
no
I
feel
the
urge
to
share
some
important
information
with
you
that
can
help
you
live
a
healthier
and
longer
life
As
a
consummate
reader
I
am
constantly
reading
books
on
self
help
and
health
I
am
currently
reading
a
great
book
on
the
current
state
of
our
health
and
what
is
causing
our
health
problems
and
numerous
deaths
due
to
different
types
of
cancer
ex
breast
cancer
and
liver
cancer
This
book
clarifies
the
confusion
around
our
daily
diet
and
the
danger
of
our
consumption
of
high
levels
of
protein
and
fat
from
animal
based
products
The
more
I
read
this
book
the
more
I
realize
that
we
are
causing
our
own
illness
The
level
of
all
types
of
cancers
and
diseases
are
higher
in
the
industrial
world
especially
in
the
western
world
The
level
of
all
types
of
cancers
are
approximately
three
times
3
higher
in
the
industrialized
nations
where
high
level
of
animal
based
products
are
consumed
as
to
that
of
Asian
and
non
industrialized
nations
where
their
diet
is
mainly
plant
based
I
think
vegetarians
are
way
ahead
of
the
curve
in
practicing
good
diet
and
maybe
we
should
take
a
page
from
their
book
Our
health
totally
depends
on
the
type
diet
that
we
follow
and
the
amount
of
our
daily
physical
activity
We
need
to
be
conscientious
of
the
amount
and
the
quality
of
food
that
we
take
in
especially
if
the
source
is
animal
based
We
need
to
decrease
the
amount
of
animal
based
protein
and
fat
that
we
consume
and
get
more
of
our
protein
and
fat
from
plant
based
products
Don
t
take
my
word
for
it
and
read
the
book
The
China
Study
and
you
will
see
what
I
am
talking
about
This
book

Shawn

In
this
book
The
China
Study
you
will
discover
the
dangers
and
the
lack
of
success
in
any
of
the
fad
diets
They
don
t
work
for
the
long
hall
and
they
even
cause
health
problems
that
you
are
not
aware
of
For
example
the
Atkins
diet
doesn
t
really
work
and
you
could
not
sustain
this
diet
forever
To
top
it
off
it
is
dangerous
to
consume
all
of
that
protein
and
fat
from
animal
based
products
Atkins
himself
was
an
obese
man
with
hearth
disease
and
high
blood
pressure
and
who
died
promoting
his
unhealthy
diet
that
finally
took
him
to
the
grave
Again
you
don

have

listen
to
me
just

book

it
will

The
Symptoms
of
Lymphoma
in
Women
Posted
by
Timothy
Allageri
Symptoms
of
lymphoma
in
women
are
generally
the
same
as
for
men
Lymphoma
often
develops
quietly
and
with
few
symptoms
so
it
may
take
a
while
before
you
may
realize
that
there
is
something
very
much
the
matter
Following
is
a
list
of
the
typical
symptoms
of
lymphoma
in
women
and
symptoms
of
lymphoma
in
men
alike
One
thing
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
these
lymphoma
symptoms
can
be
symptoms
of
any
of
a
large
number
of
conditions
that
are
generally
harmless
For
this
reason
it
s
wise
to
consult
with
your
doctor
if
you
experience
any
of
them

The
devastating
tsunami
that
ravaged
the
eastern
region
of
Fukushima
in
Japan
has
raised
a
number
of
fears
regarding
the
negative
impacts
of
radiation
exposure
on
environmental
and
human
health
The
Fukushima
Daiichi
nuclear
power
plant
was
badly
damaged
during
the
tsunami
that
hit
the
coast
on
March
11
2011
The
tsunami
resulted
from
an
8
9
magnitude
earthquake
about
80
miles
of
the
Japanese
coast
The
earthquake
is
estimated
to
have
killed
more
than
15
thousand
people
according
to
Reuters
Radiation
is

Breast
Cancer
The
Cure
Lies
In
The
Diet
Posted
by
To
deal
with
your
breast
cancer
sensibly
you
must
learn
some
basic
information
What
is
cancer
What
is
the
nature
of
the
conventional
cancer
system
What
do
doctors
think
about
alternative
cancer
treatment
What
is
a
sound
strategy
for
treating
the
cancer
and
what
specific
treatments
work
the
best
About
20
30
of
women
with
breast
cancer
have
a
family
history
of
the
disease
Breast
cancer
is
a
bunch
of
cells
in
the
breast
that
become
abnormal
for
some
reason
and
cause
mutation
The
mutated
cells
attack
other
normal
cells
and
cause
them
to
become
mutated
Some
cells
end
up
getting
destroyed
When
enough
cells
are
changed
in
this
manner
cancer
develops
Sometimes
a
small
amount
of
mutated
cells
end
up
becoming
cancerous
This
is
why
cancer
often
starts
small
in
a
certain
section
of
the
breast
and
spreads
from
there
In
stage
1
the
tumor
becomes
cancerous
and
grows
to
an
inch
in
diameter
but
does
not
spread
beyond
the
breast
In
stage
2
The
cancerous
tumor
spreads
to
the
lymph
In
stage
3
the
cancerous
tumor
has
grown
more
and
has
reached
and
penetrated
the
lymph
nodes
of
the
underarms
In
some
cases
this
type
of
cancer
has
been
known
to
spread
to
the
lymph
nodes
near
the
breastbone
or
other
tissue
near
the
breast
In
stage
4
this
is
metastatic
cancer
The
cancer
spreads
beyond
the
breast
and
lymph
nodes
to
other
parts
of
the
body
Symptoms
of
advancing
breast
cancer
may
include
Bone
pain
Breast
pain
Skin
ulcers
and
swelling
of
one
arm
next
to
breast
with
cancer
withweight
loss
Recurrent
cancer
usually
happens
when
the
treatment
radiation
chemotherapy
and
surgery
provided
earlier
did
not
get
rid
of
all
the
cancer
Some
cancer
remains
hidden
within
cells
and
is
not
destroyed
Then
the
cancer
just
spreads
quickly
and
shows
up
Besides
the
conventional
method
there
are
many
treatment
options
available
to
help
avoid
or
get
rid
of
your
cancer
The
best
method
according
to
medical
specialists
and
nutritionists
is
the
food
you
eat
According
to
research
studies
foods
that
have
healing
properties
are
the
best
to
consume
in
order
to
get
rid
of
this
disease
You
need
to
have
an
adequate
supply
of
antioxidants
such
as
fruits
vegetables
and
other
foods
The
three
most
powerful
antioxidants
are
beta
carotene
vitamin
C
and
vitamin
E
Beta
carotene
is
what
gives
many
fruits
their
appearance
It
also
stimulates
the
release
of
natural
killer
cells
which
hunt
down
and
destroy
cancer
cells
You
can
find
beta
carotene
in
cantaloupes
sweet
potatoes
spinach
and
bok
choy
There
are
substances
that
are
found
in
plant
food
known
as
phytonutrients
They
have
the
ability
to
stop
cancer
A
good
example
of
this
type
of
plant
food
is
Broccoli
In
Lab
tests
this
chemical
actually
destroyed
cancer
tissue
You
can
find
phytonutrients
in
many
other
types
of
foods
such
as
soybeans
tofu
tempeh
and
soy
milk
Another
food
that
has
been
known
for
centuries
as
a
perfect
healer
for
many
illnesses
is
garlic
A
daily
serving
of
at
least
4
ounces
of
seafood
for
the
average
person
will
prevent
and
get
rid
of
many
of
these
diseases
including
many
cancers
While
undergoing
Nature
Cure
you
follow
a
simple
diet
and
supplement
regimen
for
6
8
weeks
That
s
all
that
patients
have
found
is
necessary
to
reverse
their
cancer
There
are
certain
situations
that
neither
you
nor
your
doctor
can
control
These
situations
include
your
genes
and
family
history
But
if
you
can
learn
to
eat
right
and
make
certain
lifestyle
changes
you
may
just
find
your
chances
of
getting
cancer
reduced
or
eliminated
and
placing
yourself
In
the
position
where
you
will
lower
greatly
the
chance
of
you
getting
this
disease
Most
experts
recommend
women
age
20
and
older
should
undergo
a
routine
check
once
a
month
during
the
week
following
their
menstrual
period
and
after
40
years
of
age
a
thorough
examination
of
the
breasts
must
be
conducted
at
least
once
every
2
3
years
since
the
key
to
eliminating
cancer
is
by
catching
it
early
Women
who
had
breast
cancer
and
took
the
right
steps
found
their
breast
cancer
disappear
never
to
return

How
an
Alkaline
Diet
can
Help
you
Overcome
Cancer
Posted

It
is
highly
recommended
that
anyone
who
s
been
diagnosed
with
cancer
and
wants
to
be
proactive
in
helping
overcome
their
problem
that
they
turn
to
a
mainly
alkaline
food
intake
as
opposed
to
acid
food
Every
food
item
we
eat
is
classified
as
either
alkaline
or
acid
and
a
recommended
ratio
is
80
percent
of
our
intake
should
be
alkaline
with
the
other
20
percent
can
be
acid
The
alkaline
acid
ratio
is
measured
on
the
ph
scale
which
ranges
from
0
to
14
with
7
being
neutral
The
letters
ph
stands
for
potential
of
hydrogen

Identifying
bowel
cancer
symptoms
and
flushing
it
out
Posted
by
The
human
body
is
home
to
several
organs
and
parts
that
function
together
to
maintain
proper
health
Any
problem
in
a
single
organ
can
result
in
bodily
functions
being
impaired
to
a
great
extent
The
risk
of
cancer
has
grown
as
the
major
threat
to
individual
s
health
in
recent
times
The
rise
of
problems
like
bowel
cancer
has
been
the
cause
of
a
lot
of
apprehension
among
people
The
cure
to
cancer
lies
in
its
early
diagnoses
With
the
right
study
it
is
possible
for
medical
professionals
to
find
the
right
treatment
procedures
For
this
it
is
essential
for
patients
to
recognize
bowel
cancer
symptoms
early
and
choose
to
undergo
medical
treatment
Bowel
cancer
symptoms
develop
over
a
long
term
and
need
to
be
identified
accurately
in
order
to
avail
of
the
right
cure
Bowel
cancer
remains
among
the
more
prevalent
forms
of
cancer
in
the
modern
world
It
is
also
the
second
most
prominent
form
of
cancer
in
the
United
States
of
America
This
makes
it
all
the
more
important
to
be
identified
correctly
There
are
many
bowel
cancer
symptoms
like
bloating
constipation
and
stomach
pain
that
can
be
mistaken
for
common
ailments
This
can
be
dangerous
In
addition
to
these
patients
should
look
out
for
sudden
loss
of
appetite
vomiting
nausea
and
diarrhea
as
bowel
cancer
symptoms
There
can
also
be
rectal
bleeding
in
many
of
these
cases
The
bowel
cancer
symptoms
are
both
discomforting
and
painful
for
many
people
The
nature
of
the
symptoms
also
makes
them
very
difficult
to
distinguish
The
solution
to
this
lies
in
the
use
of
colonoscopy
as
an
identification
technique
The
colonoscopy
is
a
method
through
which
it
is
possible
to
examine
the
entire
colon
using
fiber
optics
and
video
chips
This
will
help
the
doctors
to
connect
the
bowel
cancer
symptoms
with
the
problem
with
more
accuracy
Time
is
of
crucial
importance
in
these
cases
The
immediate
identification
of
the
bowel
cancer
symptoms
can
help
in
formulating
the
right
treatment
at
an
early
stage
and
increase
the
chances
of
recovery
for
the
patient
There
are
many
medical
centers
offering
these
facilities
to
patients
across
the
world
It
is
important
to
choose
the
right
professionals
for
the
task

One
woman
in
eight
who

age
85
will
develop
breast
cancer
at
some
time
during
her
life
Breast
cancer
is
not
just
a
woman
s
disease
The
American
Cancer
Society
estimates
that
1600
men
develop
the
disease
yearly
and
about
400
may
die
from
the
disease
Breast
cancer
risk
is
higher
among
those
who
have
a
mother
aunt
sister
or
grandmother
who
had
breast
cancer
before
age
50
If
only
a
mother
or
sister
had
breast
cancer
your
risk
doubles
Having
two
first
degree
relatives
who
were
diagnosed
increases
your
risk
up
to
five
times
the
average
For

cancer
the
risks
are
harder
to

known
that
the
hormone
estrogen
feeds
many
breast
cancers
and
several
factors
diet
excess
weight
and
alcohol
consumption
can
raise
the
body
s
estrogen
levels
There
are
several
risk
factors
that
are
responsible
for
breast
cancer
Following
are
some
risk
factors
Genetic
factors
Changes
in
a
woman
s
genes
including
BRCA1
BRCA2
and
others
may
increase
the
risk
for
breast
cancer
Tests
from
family
members
who
have
been
known
to
have
breast
cancer
can
reveal
the
presence
of
specific
gene
changes
in
family
members
In
order
to
improve
the
detection
of
this
disease
in
women
who
have
these
changes
in
their
genes
health
care
providers
may
be

ways
to

Breast
Cancer

Posted

According
to
the
figures
released
by
the
National
Cancer
Institute
207
890
fresh
cases
of
breast
cancer
emerged
in

through
2010
Fresh

the

970
mark
Breast
cancer
is
easily
one
of
the
most
terrifying
diseases
for
the
modern
day
woman
It
is
often
shrouded
in
the
midst
of
thousands
of
fears
and
uncertainties
The
primary
ones
include
loss
of
sexuality
and
self
image
death
surgery
painful
treatment
procedures
and
many
more
The
doctor
has
a
task
on
hand
to
assure
the
patient
and
motivate
her
to
go
in
for
positive
treatment
therapies
Treatment
of
breast
cancer
will
largely
depend
on
the
type
of
the
disease
Most
victims
consider
this
type
ofcancer
to
be
a
term
representing
a
single
disease
This
is
a
misconception
Cancerous
growth
within
the
breasts
can
occur
in
several
forms
One
could
be
the
localized
form
of
cancer
which
confines
itself
to
the
breast
and
surrounding
areas
Other
severe
forms
could
include
the
typically
invasive
type
of
cancerous
growths
which
metastasize
over
time
and
spread
through
the
various
essential
organs
of
the
body
In
between
these
two
extreme
types
there
could
be
partially
invasive
types
as
well
which
holds
the
promise
of
a
positive
prognosis
Sometimes
non
invasive
growths
could
be
found
around
invasive
breast
cancer
Diagnosing
the
specific
type
of
breast
cancer
is
of
utmost
importance
The
treatment
is
administered
as
per
the
type
of
breast
cancer

Ideally
the
doctor
would
be
explaining

patient

respect
to
the

of
breast
cancer
present
and
the
course
of
treatment
which
needs
to

undertaken
for
the

Advantages
of
laparoscopic
prostatectomy
surgery
Posted
by
It
is
not
always
the
truth
that
benign
prostatic
hyperplasia
will
result
in
the
demand
for
surgical
treatment
Understanding
what
remedies
are
available
and
the
likelihood
there
will
likely
be
a
full
cure
is
what
the
patient
wants
to
know
when
a
doctor
initially
informs
them
of
the
diagnosis
made
When
the
medical
diagnosis
is
negative
and
the
patient
doesn
t
have
cancer
you
will
have
no
need
for
prostate
cancer
surgery
Although
the
patient
may
possibly
have
an
enlarged
gland
the
signs
and
symptoms
can
in
some
cases
be
confused
as
to
whether
this
is
benign
prostatic
hyperplasia
Only
in
situations
where
it
is
unquestionably
necessary
might
a
medical
doctor
recommend
surgery
is
required
A
good
medical
doctor
will
look
for
non
surgical
treatments
first
Patients
who
return
with
a
alternate
prognosis
may
not
fare
so
well
Medical
doctors
will
suggest
chemotherapy
non
invasive
procedures
or
prostate
cancer
surgery
depending
on
how
far
the
cancer
has
extended
and
the
measurements
of
the
tumor
He
may
recommend
a
laparoscopic
prostatectomy
The
patient
usually
takes
some
time
to
digest
the
news
No
one
ever
wishes
to
hear
the
primary
prognosis
and
the
subsequent
recommendation
typically
causes
a
person
to
get
a
deeper
level
of
shock

Mesothelioma
A
dangerous
form
of
cancer
Posted
by
Malignant
mesothelioma
me
zoe
thee
lee
OH
muh
is
a
rare
cancer
that
occurs
in
the
thin
layer
of
tissue
that
covers
the
majority
of
your
internal
organs
mesothelium
Doctors
divide
mesothelioma
into
different
types
based
on
what
part
of
the
mesothelium
is
affected
Mesothelioma
most
often
affects
the
tissue
that
surrounds
the
lungs
pleura
This
type
is
called
pleural
malignant
mesothelioma
Other
rarer
types
of
mesothelioma
affect
tissue
in
the
abdomen
around
the
heart
and
around
the
testicles
Mesothelioma
is
an
aggressive
and
deadly
form
of
cancer
Mesothelioma
treatments
are
available
but
for
many
people
with
mesothelioma
a
cure
is
not
possible
Instead
treatment
for
mesothelioma
is
often
focused
on
keeping
you
as
comfortable
as
possible
In
general
cancer
begins
when
a
series
of
genetic
mutations
occur
within
a
cell
causing
the
cell
to
grow
and
multiply
out
of
control
It
isn
t
clear
what
causes
the
initial
genetic
mutations
that
lead
to
mesothelioma
though
researchers
have
identified
factors
that
may
increase
the
risk
It
s
likely
that
cancers
form
because
of
an
interaction
between
many
factors
such
as
inherited
conditions
your
environment
your
health
conditions
and
your
lifestyle
choices
Mesothelioma
doesn
t
include
a
noncancerous
tumor
A
form
of
noncancerous
benign
tumor
that
can
occur
in
the
chest
is
sometimes
called
benign
mesothelioma
However
this
name
is
misleading
Benign
mesothelioma
doesn
t
begin
in
the
same
cells
where
the
cancerous
forms
of
mesothelioma
begin
And
in
a
minority
of
cases
benign
mesothelioma
can
be
very
aggressive
despite
the
term
benign
For
this
reason
some
doctors
now
refer
to
this
tumor
as
solitary
fibrous
tumor

The
Cure
for
Cancer
Posted
by
The
Cure
for
Cancer
I
receive
many
emails
asking
for
me
to
pray
for
the
cure
for
cancer
and
always
see
people
doing
sponsored
events
to
raise
funds
for
research
to
find
the
cure
But
do
we
not
already
know
what
the
cure
is
Apparently
everyone
has
cancer
cells
or
pre
cancerous
cells
in
their
body
and
the
body
s
immune
system
disposes
of
these
naturally
It
s
only
when
the
immune
system
is
down
that
the
body
is
unable
to
fight
and
dispose
of
these
cells
that
they
begin
to
multiply
to
a
detectable
level

Posted

You
might
have
heard
about
the
health
benefits
of
resveratrol
It
has
been
in
the
news
for
the
past
couple
of
years
Resveratrol
comes
from
the
skin
of
grapes
and
has
been
touted
as
an
amazing
cholesterol
buster
and
antioxidant
It
s
not
surprising
then
that
researchers
at
Colorado
State
University
just
completed
a
new
study
examining
the
health
benefits
of
grape
seed
extract
and
resveratrol
together
The
U
S
researchers
found
that
grape
seed
extract
could
inhibit
the
growth
of
colon
cancer
cells
in
the
laboratory
Colon
cancer

Testing
for
bladder
stones
Posted
by
Unlike
the
stones
which
form
in
the
kidneys
in
the
body
the
bladder
stones
are
firmer
harder
and
tougher
to
expel
out
of
the
body
We
must
be
aware
that
bladder
stones
are
those
solid
crystals
which
develop
in
the
urinary
balder
They
cause
symptoms
like
pain
in
lower
abdomen
and
more
importantly
difficulty
in
passing
urine
The
testing
and
treatment
of
the
same
is
important
to
avoid
further
complications
and
infections
Along
with
test
like
the
x
rays
a
rectal
examination
may
also
be
carried
out
Basically
while
testing
for
bladder
stones
the
medical
healthcare
experts
generally
examine
the
entire
body
to
ensure
that
there
is
no
other
cause
for
the
symptoms
The
first
step
is
radiography
by
way
of
x
rays
which
may
confirm
the
presence
of
stones
For
further
clarification
cystoscopy
may
be
performed
This
is
an
endoscope
procedure
where
the
medical
device
is
entered
into
the
body
through
the
urethra
The
urinary
bladder
is
then
examined
In
this
case
since
it
is
a
diagnostic
procedure
the
individual
may
be
administered
only
local
anesthesia
In
operative
methods
general
anesthesia
may
be
required
The
urine
sample
is
also
analyzed
because
when
bladder
stones
develop
they
also
affect
the
concentration
and
composition
of
the
urine
which
is
to
be
removed
out
of
the
body
Various
compounds
present
in
the
urine
are
chemically
and
physically
tested
The
examination
is
also
carried
out
at
the
microscopic
level
The
physical
testing
reports
the
basic
coloration
and
appearance
A
urine
specific
gravity
test
may
be
performed
to
understand
the
dilution
of
the
urine
While
the
chemical
test
confirms
the
substance
present
the
microscopic
test
confirms
whether
there
are
any
suspicious
germs
mucous
or
crystals
The
health
and
nature
of
the
cells
can
be
determined
Additionally
the
urine
culture
tests
confirm
if
any
bacteria
are
harbored
in
the
excretory
liquid
In
adults
and
children
this
test
helps
in
confirming
the
presence
or
absence
of
infections
This
is
useful
because
the
information
aids
the
course
of
action
for
cure

cancer
patients
need
to
meet
with
a
specialist
for
a
second
opinion
Posted
by
An
analysis
of
cancer
of
the
breast
brings
a
lot
of
stress
and
disruption
towards
the
lives
of
stricken
patients
as
well
as
their
families
Past
the
shock
of
first
learning
she
s
cancer
of
the
breast
a
lady
must
make
a
number
of
choices
about
treatments
as
well
as
their
potential
effects
in
addition
to
changes
in
her
own
existence
to
support
the
uninvitedchanges
introduced
with
a
breast
cancer
diagnosis
Frequently
it
s
not
easy
to
create
these
choices
within
the
small
amount
of
time
following
a
diagnosis
particularly
when
attempting
to
adjust
while
driven
through
the
anxiety
about
the
condition
and
possibly
believe
it
or
not
the
worry
of
treatment
It
is
important
for
patients
identified
with
cancer
of
the
breast
to
invest
an
sufficient
period
of
time
researching
the
condition
its
prognosis
and
all
sorts
of
available
treatments
This
understanding
can
help
them
get
the
best
choices
they
are
able
to
to
optimize
their
outcome

What
Is
God
s
Problem
Posted
by
Timothy
Allageri
If
He
is
up
there
he
won
t
answer
because
he
doesn
t
want
to
or
He
cant
answer
because
he
isn
t
there
In
in
either
case
we
are
left
her
to
wonder
like
idiots
I
want
definitive
proof
because
the
Holy
Bible
tells
me
so
doesn
t
cut
it
the
Holy
Qua
ran
tells
me
so
doesn
t
cut
it
The
Jewish
notion
that
they
are
the
chosen
people
because
the
Torah
told
them
so
doesn
t
cut
it
If
I
write
done
on
a
piece
of
paper
something
scientific
or
insightful
or
that
I
witnessed
a
miracle
and
am
willing
to
die
to
defend
what
I
wrote
down
is
true
Does
that
make
it
true
Think
what
does
it
mean
to
have
faith
if
having
faith
involves
not
knowing
for
sure
Isn
t
the
message
simply
don
t
be
an
be
kind
and
generous
I
ve
been
exposed
to
asbestos
so
it
will
come
as
no
surprise
if
I
die
from
lung
cancer
if
I
live
long
enough
When
it
happened
I
had
no
idea
what
it
was
never
heard
of
the
word
What
is
God
s
problem
anyway
Does
this
sound
like
something
a
loving
God
would
do
I
m
just
one
person
the
whole
world
is
full
of
worse
fates
than
my
own
If
I
saw
god
right
now
do
you
know
what
I
would
say
to
Him
WTF
I
m
a
good
person
You
are
a
cruel
master
Has
this
thought
ever
occurred
to
anyone
Is
the
whole
world
evil
is
that
why
God
doesn
t
care
Is
God
not
powerful
enough
to
defeat
or
prevent
corruption
from
the
devil
If
something
is
true
shouldn
t
be
obvious
Religious
people
going
around
shouting
It
s
the
truth
It
s
the
truth
In
fact
they
don
t
acutely
know
but
just
say
it
s
the
truth
just
in
case
Is
that
it
is
religion
just
a
precaution

Does
This
Dude
Like
Me
Or
Is
It
All
In
My
Head
Posted
by
Timothy
Allageri
My
best
guy
friend
and
I
sit
next
to
each
other
on
the
bus
He
was
really
quiet
the
first
few
days
we
started
sitting
together
even
though
he
had
already
known
me
For
the
past
2
weeks
he
has
little
shenanigans
that
are
really
funny
For
example
last
Friday
he
started
poking
me
in
my
stomach
trying
to
find
my
tickle
spots
and
pinching
my
sides
whilst
we
were
both
thinking
it
was
hilarious
and
today
on
the
way
home
he
found
a
marker
on
the
floor
of
the
bus
and
we
started
marking
all
over
each
other
again
thinking
it
was
funny
He
tries
making
me
laugh
a
lot
i
e
putting
my
pink
breast
cancer
awareness
bow
in
his
hair
and
is
very
socially
awkward
and
shy
person
that
doesn
t
have
many
friends
that
are
girls
while
I
am
emo
with
heavy
makeup
and
hair
with
not
very
many
friends
whatsoever
BTW
I
am
a
freshman
he
is
a
sophomore
in
high
school
of
course

A
few
things

first
day
of
this
marathon
period
Also
I

Cancer

Why
Do
Many
Serbian
Women
Have
Plastic
Surgery
Posted
by
Timothy
Allageri
This
is
a
legitimate
question
I
am
doing
a
paper
on
Media
Stream
Cultural
clash
I
have
chosen
Serbia
as
a
country
of
choice
because
I
have
a
Serbian
friend
whose
mother
watches
Serbian
channel
day
in
and
day
out
I
am
also
over
at
their
house
like
6
days
a
week
she
s
basically
my
sister
Anyway
80
of
the
people
appear
in
the
channels
have
so
much
plastic
surgery
or
makeup
on
So
why
do
you
think
a
lot
of
women
there
received
many
surgeries
Do
you
think
this
is
a
great
way
to
educate
younger
generations
How
do
you
think
this
will
effect
children
and
how
they
interpret
what
beauty
is
For
fun
My
friends
and
her
friends
cousins
tans
A
LOT
Do
they
have
doctoral
warnings
in
Serbia
regarding
skin
cancer
lung
and
colon
cancer
Lung
pertaining
to
heavy
smokers
and
constant
meat
eaters
Just
askin
because
her
mom
smokes
a
lot
but
won
t
quit
man
I
even
tried
giving
her
the
fake
cigs
And
if
they
do
have
those
warnings
do
they
actually
make
an
effort
to
brainwash
people
kind
of
like
what
they
do
in
America
good
and
bad
so
they
will
make
a
healthier
lifestyle
Skinny
doesn
t
always
mean
healthy
Fat
doesn
t
always
mean
unhealthy
Thanks

Why
Do
Natural
Deodorants
Irritate
My
Skin
Posted
by
Timothy
Allageri
Switching
from
the
big
brand
deodorants
to
more
natural
chemical
free
deodorants
seemed
like
a
no
brainer
what
with
no
aluminum
to
cause
breast
cancer
but
every
time
I
use
natural
deodorants
my
skin
starts
to
sting
and
turns
red
I
never
had
this
problem
with
the
typical
store
brands
Dove
and
others
even
though
they
have
more
things
in
them
that
s
just
not
good
to
put
on
your
skin
Why
is
this
happening
I
shave
daily
however
it
doesn
t
seem
to
matter
how
long
after
I
shave
I
put
the
deodorant
on
It
always
stings
and
turns
my
skin
red
and
every
natural
brand
I
ve
ever
used
has
caused
this

I
m
14
And
Worried
About
Seeing
A
Gyno
girls
Only
Please
Posted
by
Timothy
Allageri
I
m
14
and
I
have
had
my
period
for
just
over
a
year
My
mum
is
a
wonderful
mum
and
is
very
protective
which
is
great
most
of
the
time
She
hasn
t
told
me
that
I
have
to
go
and
see
a
gyno
yet
but
her
mum
my
grandmother
died
of
breast
cancer
and
her
mum
my
great
grandmother
of
cervical
cancer
both
at
young
ages
so
I
can
understand
her
concern
The
thought
of
someone
touching
me
in
private
areas
makes
me
feel
sick
not
because
it
is
disgusting
or
whatever
but
it
genuinely
terrifies
me
I
know
it
probably
sounds
irrational
and
I
know
it
is
important
for
my
health
but
I
m
literally
shaking
writing
this
I
know
that
I
will
have
to
go
in
the
next
few
years
but
I
wanted
to
ask
if
I
would
be
allowed
to
take
my
best
friend
with
me
I
won
t
feel
comfortable
with
my
mum
there
but
my
best
friend
is
6
months
older
than
me
and
I
would
trust
her
with
my
life
I
know
that
she
would
come
if
I
asked
her
to
but
I
was
wondering
if
I
would
be
allowed
Thanks

Vagina
And
Vulva
Problems
Posted
by
Timothy
Allageri
I
m
a
15
year
old
girl
I
ll
be
16
in
a
little
over
a
month
I
ve
had
a
boyfriend
for
about
a
year
now
and
I
sort
of
have
a
problem
I
don
t
think
I
have
any
sexual
feeling
down
there
My
boyfriend
has
fingered
me
and
ate
me
out
but
I
think
he
possibly
gets
more
pleasure
from
it
than
I
do
It
doesn
t
hurt
it
just
feels
like
someone
is
touching
my
arm
and
when
he
penetrates
my
vagina
with
his
fingers
it
sometimes
feels
uncomfortable
He
likes
to
suck
on
and
feel
my
breasts
but
I
get
no
pleasure
from
this
either
When
I
masturbate
and
try
new
things
by
myself
I
still
do
not
feel
pleasure
I
think
something
is
wrong
with
me
I
have
no
STD
s
I
just
got
bloodwork
done
to
check
for
cancer
but
I
am
on
generic
brands
of
prozac
and
ortho
tri
cyclen
for
acne
I
am
a
virgin
as
well
What
could
be
wrong
with
me

What
Do
You
Think
Of
Smoking
In
Moderation
Posted
by
Timothy
Allageri
Government
and
mass
media
keeps
hammering
this
into
our
heads
that
cigarettes
cause
lung
cancer
etc
But
it
simply
feels
so
much
pleasure
that
I
can
t
agree
with
it
I
believe
we
re
being
lied
to
by
Government
and
anti
tobacco
lobby
I
know
several
older
people
who
still
smoke
a
pack
a
day
and
feel
healthy
and
active
Cigarettes
make
me
feel
alert
productive
and
sharper
The
only
gripe
I
have
is
with
chain
smoking
cause
it
irritates
the
throat
and
I
don
t
enjoy
the
smoker
s
cough
But
once
it
s
settled
down
it
s
back
to
usual

What
To
Do
About
What
My
Teacher
Calls
Me
Being
stage
Shy
Posted
by
Timothy
Allageri
The
class
is
all
about
being
free
and
feeling
good
in
your
skin
which
the
teacher
says
will
help
with
going
in
front
of
others
to
sing
The
thing
is
I
and
free
and
feeling
just
fine
in
my
own
skin
but
he
call
me
stage
shy
which
is
quite
true
I
have
these
chills
and
get
shaky
even
just
in
front
of
my
other
gt
chorus
members
when
I
sing
in
the
stage
class
Because
I
am
the
only
one
with
this
problem
in
my
class
my
teacher
likes
to
pick
on
me
and
make
me
sing
the
most
Now
my
class
members
just
choose
my
to
be
group
leader
And
I
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
I
say
sarcastically
which
I
am
pretty
good
at
leading
but
this
also
means
that
I
have
I
to
do
a
lot
of
song
starting
singing
and
main
singer
crap
and
well
I
am
stage
shy
as
my
teacher
likes
to
call
it
How
can
I
make
this
go
away
this
is
not
a
good
for
the
upcoming
cancer
charity
concert
we
are
supposed
to
have
towards
the
end
of
the
year
at
which
I
am
supposed
to
do
the
BIG
ending
singing
Prayer
by
Celine
Dion
Just
thinking
about
it
makes
me
shaky
I
need
some
help
Please
all
the
advice
possible
is
needed

Posted

Timothy
Allageri
I
think
this
is
absolutely
ridiculous
but
I
was
talking
to
my
sister
last
night
and
she
said
that
she
believed
and
focused
her
thoughts
on
her
labor
and
this
is
what
she
said
With
Ellie
her
daughter
I
visualized
that
I
would
be
about
a
week
overdue
I
would
have
her
in
the
water
squatting
my
labor
would
be
about
5
hours
and
she
would
be
born
in
the
water
bag
she
was
born
about
a
week
late
I
squatted
in
the
water
my
labor
was
7
hours
and
she
was
born
in
the
bag
I
told
her
that
this
sounded
equivalent
to
believing
and
visualizing
that
your
cancer
will
go
away
and
the
next
day
its
gone
she
said
there
are
all
kinds
of
moms
who
did
this
and
had
exactly
what
they
visualized
I
kind
of
dont
believe
her
and
think
she
sounds
nuts
shes
all
mother
nature
and
thinks
the
universe
controls
things
and
believes
in
healing
power
and
energy
healing
people
if
that
was
true
then
you
think
my
moms
cancer
would
be
gone
by
now
what
are
your
thoughts
on
this

I
Need
Some
Comforting
Advice
Posted
by
Timothy
Allageri
My
dog
has
cushing
disease
but
has
not
yet
been
tested
and
the
Dr
says
that
she
s
99
99
positive
that
s
what
it
is
but
to
what
degree
we
won
t
know
until
the
testing
is
done
and
the
test
alone
will
cost
200
she
s
8yrs
old
she
s
now
blind
and
has
high
blood
pressure
and
she
just
started
taking
BP
medication
she
s
also
bloated
and
I
have
been
told
that
she
can
medicated
to
make
her
comfortable
and
actually
feel
a
lot
better
and
that
would
cost
anywhere
between
50
100
a
month
and
then
2
or
3wks
later
the
doggie
will
have
to
be
tested
again
to
make
sure
she
s
on
the
correct
dosage
of
medication
and
that
would
be
another
200
and
then
there
after
she
will
have
to
be
tested
every
3mos
to
find
out
if
her
medication
needs
to
be
increased
Now
the
thing
is
I
really
can
t
afford
all
of
these
costs
I
just
got
through
fighting
a
stage
3
breast
cancer
and
still
awaiting
surgeries
and
the
whole
cancer
thing
of
course
is
never
a
planned
thing
and
my
aunt
that
took
care
of
me
during
my
cancer
battle
just
passed
away
yesterday
from
lung
cancer
which
happen
so
so
fast
and
this
is
really
tearing
me
apart
and
now
that
my
aunt
isn
t
here
anymore
I
am
now
taking
care
of
grandma
who
is
90yrs
old
and
with
all
of
this
going
on
I
have
been
told
that
I
should
put
my
dog
to
sleep
and
i
can
t
stop
crying
because
of
the
loss
of
my
aunt
who
in
my
eyes
is
and
has
been
my
angel
and
now
to
have
to
put
my
doggie
down
the
day
after
the
passing
of
my
aunt
well
it
feels
like
my
insides
are
just
being
torn
apart
I
don
t
know
if
my
doggie
is
in
pain
and
I
guess
putting
her
to
sleep
is
the
right
thing
to
do
my
doggie
s
life
span
was
suppose
to
be
about
15yrs
and
this
is
just
putting
me
over
the
edge
i
never
thought
i
would
fall
so
much
in
love
with
a
dog
What
kind
of
advice
can
you
give
me
to
help
ease
the
pain
By
the
way
i
have
already
tried
to
find
some
type
of
clinic
to
help
people
with
low
income
but
I
haven
t
had
any
luck
and
I
live
in
So
California

You
feel
that
you
shouldnt
pay
for
others
sexual
choices
right
Using
that
same
logic
Why
should
I
have
to
pay
for
lung
cancer
treatment
of
those
patients
who
smoke
Why
should
I
have
to
pay
for
the
coverage
of
viagra
Like
I
said
the
joy
of
having
insurance
is
so
that
you
have
it
for
whatever
you
need
it
for
Thats
why
Im
paying
hundreds
of
dollars
a
month
through
my
employer
for
insurance
and
some
of
that
money
is
going
towards
treatments
like
i
mentioned
by
the
way
it
has
been
proven
that
a
lack
of
sex
between
married
couples
will
most
likely
result
in
cheating
and
divorce
Take
a
look
at
a
married
couple
that
dosent
have
sex
and
see
how
unhappy
they
look

Why

Posted
by
Timothy
Allageri
You
feel
that
you
shouldnt
pay
for
others
sexual
choices
right
Using
that
same
logic
Why
should
I
have
to
pay
for
lung
cancer
treatment
of
those
patients
who
smoke
Why
should
I
have
to
pay
for
the
coverage
of
viagra
Like
I
said
the
joy
of
having
insurance
is
so
that
you
have
it
for
whatever
you
need
it
for
Thats
why
Im
paying
hundreds
of
dollars
a
month
through
my
employer
for
insurance
and
some
of
that
money
is
going
towards
treatments
like
i
mentioned
by
the
way
it
has
been
proven
that
a
lack
of
sex
between
married
couples
will
most
likely
result
in
cheating
and
divorce
Take
a
look
at
a
married
couple
that
dosent
have
sex
and
see
how
unhappy
they
look

When
last
we
saw
Michael
Lohan
here
on
the
blog
he
was
hospitalized
in
Florida
due
to
heart
and
liver
problems
You
may
recall
that
his
hospitalization
came
about
a
month
after
he
was
arrested
for
the
second
time
for
violating
the
restraining
order
placed
on
him
by
his
ex
girlfriend
Kate
Major

Paulo
Filho
on
Fighting
I
Don
t
Want
This
Anymore
Posted
on
October
23
2011
by
Filed
under
News
Former
WEC
middleweight
champion
Paulo
Filho
says
he
is
ready
to
close
the
book
on
his
competitive
MMA
career
In
a
recent
interview
with
Brazil
s
Tatame
Filho
says
he
plans
on
retiring
after
his
Nov
26
fight
at
KSW
17
against
Mamed
Khalidov
if
that
fight
even
happens
I
may
fight
in
November
because
I
already
signed
the
contract
after
that
I
will
retire
he
tells
Tatame
I
don
t
want
this
anymore
In
his
prime
in
2006
2007
Filho
was
widely
considered
to
be
the
No
2
middleweight
in
the
world
just
under
Anderson
Silva
But
since
the
two
are
friends
a
fight
between
the
two
never
went
past
what
if
discussions
by
fans
and
media
At
the
time
Silva
touted
Filho
as
the
best
middleweight
in
the
world
After
going
16
0
in
the
first
seven
years
of
his
career
Filho
suffered
his
first
loss
at
WEC
36
against
Chael
Sonnen
and
never
quite
recovered
His
battles
with
depression
and
substance
abuse
in
the
Tatame
interview
Filho
said
his
only
drug
issue
was
with
rohypnol
a
prescription
sedative
had
impacted
his
work
inside
the
cage
Following
the
loss
to
Sonnen
Filho
was
not
picked
up
by
the
UFC
and
has
since
compiled
a
6
3
2
record
In
his
last
fight
Filho
fought
Satoshi
Ishii
to
a
draw
a
decision
rendered
by
what
appeared
to
be
partisan
judges
in
the
Brazilian
event
Filho
himself
after
the
fight
said
Ishii
should
have
been
awarded
the
win
Past
the
Nov
26
fight
the
33
year
old
Filho
is
unsure
of
what
he
wants
to
do
next
But
it
s
not
MMA
I
m
not
thinking
about
that
right
now
but
I
don
t
wanna
know
about
fighting
anymore
Filho
said
I
had
good
and
horrible
moments
I
did
what
I
could
it
s
over
I
was
far
from
what
I
could
have
been
but
I
m
satisfied
It
s
over

What
is
each
UFC
Title
really
worth
Looking
at
the

behind
each
UFC

Here
s
how
this
works
I
am
going
to
look
at
a
number
of
factors
that
can
affect
the
value
of
each
title
currently
being
held
and
defended
inside
the
UFC
I
will
list
the
factors
pros
and
cons
and
numbers
behind
each
title
this
will
lead
me
to
a
final
score
the
level
of
prestige
that
comes
with
winning
the
title
as
compared
to
the
others
the
numerical
value
of
the
title
on
a
scale
of

to

The
Heavyweight
Title
is
generally
considered
to
be
the
most
prestigious
in
all
of
fighting
regardless
of
what
organization
it
is
in
I
understand
the
consensus
behind
that
but
I
don
t
necessarily
agree
with
it
Many
top
level
competitors
have
held
this
belt
including
Bas
Rutten
Randy
Couture
Tim
Sylvia
Brock
Lesnar
and
Frank
Mir
It
has
clearly
been
held
by
a
number
of
current
and
future
hall
of
famers
and
that
certainly
adds
some
shine
to
the
gold
I
think
the
most
dominant
champion
would
probably
be
considered
to
be
Brock
Lesnar
as
he
came
saw
and
conquered
then
defended
it
twice
to
tie
the
record
of
most
defenses
Given
all
of
the
factors
and
removing
the
general
field
of
thought
the
numbers
speak
volumes
about
the
title
Although
there
have
been
16
undisputed
champions
the
title
has
only
been
defended
successfully
12
times
This
means
that
a
defending
heavyweight
champion
has
a
25
chance
of
losing
the
belt
in
his
first
defense
with
a
decrease
to
20
if
you
count
the
interim
reigns
It
is
certainly
one
of
the
hardest
titles
to
hold
onto
with
an
increasingly
dangerous
division
this
belt
certainly
lends
some
serious
swagger
to
its
holder
Total
Value
Out
Of
100
86
It
s
a
hard
title
to
win
and
it
s
an
even
harder
title
to
keep
that
definitely
increases
its
value
It
is
considered
to
be
the
most
sought
after
title
in
the
UFC
and
for
good
reason
it
means
you
re
the
biggest
baddest
and
scariest
guy
in
the
world
of
mixed
martial
arts
That
doesn
t
mean
its
actual
value
should
be
increased
that
s
why
I
have
put
it
at
an
86
because
it
s
definitely
a
title
everyone
wants
but
it
is
also
a
title
that
if
you
get
in
a
match
for
it
you
have
a
reasonable
chance
of
getting
it

Tito
Ortiz
This
title
has
a
fantastic
history
originally
being
called
the
middleweight
title
until
it
was
renamed
in
2001
with
the
adoption
of
the
unified
rules
A
large
majority
of
its
time
has
been
spent
around
the
waist
of
current
or
future
hall
of
famers
perhaps
more
than
any
other
title
in
the
UFC
I
have
many
fond
memories
of
its
defenses
and
the
feuds
that
went
along
with
them
most
notably
Chuck
Liddell
and
Tito
Ortiz
There
were
a
number
of
times
that
I
believed
this
title
would
never
change
hands
for
instance
once
Rampage
won
the
belt
I
figured
this
is
it
this
guy
s
a
monster
Fate
has
a
funny
way
of
moving
the
title
and
no
way
could
be
funnier
than
Forrest
Griffin
s
leg
kick
domination
of
Rampage
Some
of
the
title
reigns
feeling
like
flukes
do
affect
the
value
of
the
title
but
I
believe
as
it
stands
having
a
champion
who
is
an
absolute
monster
like
Jon
Jones
will
only
serve
to
raise
the
value
Total
Value
Out
Of
100
78
I
only
have
it
as
low
as
78
because
of
how
hard
the
past
champions
have
fallen
Chuck
Tito
and
Forrest
have
all
become
afterthoughts
in
the
world
of
MMA
and
it
s
for
the
best
as
they
are
clearly
past
their
respective
primes
The
fact
that
it
s
highly
defended
certainly
brought
the
number
up
quite
a
bit
but
now
that
Jon
Jones
has
his
hands
on
the
belt
and
holding
down
the
throne
I
would
expect
to
see
a
great
increase

the

Anderson

It
certainly
works
in
this
title
s
favor
that
it
has
the
best
pound
for
pound
fighter
in
the
world
wearing
it
around
his
waist
and
he
has
been
for
over
five
years
now
He
is
clearly
the
most
dominant
champion
in
UFC
history
and
adds
such
a
large
amount
of
value
to
this
belt
Sure
most
people
look
at
the
name
Dave
Menne
and
go
Who
the
heck
is
that
And
I
don
t
blame
them
the
guy
is
truly
an
after
thought
in
the
MMA
world
but
that
s
no
fault
of
his
own
he
was
the
inaugural
champion
after
all
The
title
started
gaining
its
value
when
Rich
Franklin
took
it
from
Evan
Tanner
in
2005
and
ever
since
it
has
been
the
hardest
title
to
get
your
hands
on
Did
I
mention
that
Anderson
Silva
is
the
best
fighter
on
the
planet
and
will
probably
retire
holding
this
belt
In
10
years
of
existence
this
belt
has
only
had
five
champions
the
most
recent
owner
Silva
has
had
it
for
half
of
its
lifespan
This
is
the
hardest
to
attain
belt
in
mixed
martial
arts
right
now
and
for
good
reason
as
the
champion
should
be
considered
MMA
royalty
Total
Value
Out
Of

The
only
thing
that
could
raise
the
value
of
this
belt
is
having
the
first
two
champions
erased
from
the
record
and
start
the
title
history
with
a
fighter
like
Evan
Tanner
When
Evan
Tanner
passed
away
in
2008
he
felt
he
had
gone
flat
inside
the
cage
but
he
did
lose
the
title
to
Rich
Franklin
a
future
hall
of
famer
This
belt
doesn
t
have
the
lengthy
history
that
the
others
do
but
that
s
exactly
why
it
s
the
most
coveted

This

has

been
held
by
current
and

members
of
the
UFC
Hall
of
Fame
with
the
exception
of
Carlos
Newton
and
Matt
Serra
Starting
with
Pat
Miletich
and
moving
to
Georges
St
Pierre
this
title
has
been
on
the
waist
of
some
of
the
greatest
fighters
in
MMA
history
GSP
is
clearly
the
second
best
pound
for
pound
fighter
in
the
world
and
since
regaining
the
title
in
2008
has
showed
an
unmatched
brilliance
inside
of
the
cage
Between
GSP
Hughes
and
Miletich
you
have
every
title
defense
ever
in
the
history
of
this
belt
B
J
Penn
also
notably
held
this
title
in
2004
before
being
stripped
for
making
the
jump
to
K
1
There
has
not
been
a
lot
of
controversy
around
this
belt
and
I
don
t
currently
believe
anyone
in
the
division
is
going
to
get
it
off
of
the
current
champ
anytime
soon
If
it
winds
up
in
the
hands
of
Nick
Diaz
or
Carlos
Condit
and
they
have
a
one
and
done
type
of
reign
the
value
will
drop
Total

Out

The
fact
that
GSP
looks
like
a
vulnerable
champion
right
now
with
only
two
solid
contenders
left
in
the
division
took
away
some
overall
points
but
the
division
although
the
top
tier
looks
a
little
crowded
isn
t
as
deep
as
it
could
be
because
St
Pierre
has
already
beaten
almost
anybody
who
he
could
fight
for
the
title
aside
from
Diaz
and
Condit
and
possibly
Johny
Hendricks
I
expect
to
see
it
around
the
waist
of
GSP
for
a
couple
of
more
years
before
someone
manages
to
take
it

This
title
has
had
kind
of
an
odd
history
the
first
champion
was
stripped
of
the
title
and
then
a
four
man
tournament
was
held
which
ended
in
a
draw
It
was
then
left
vacant
until
2006
when
it
was
captured
by
Sean
Sherk
who
was
in
turn
stripped
of
the
title
for
testing
positive
for
steroids
After
that
things
kind
of
evened
out
with
B
J
Penn
taking
the
title
to
some
prominence
and
Frankie
Edgar
also
lending
a
hand
to
the
value
I
don
t
know
if
I
believe
that
Edgar
will
still
be
the
champion
after
UFC
144
and
his
bout
with
Ben
Henderson
because
things
in
the
lightweight
division
are
really
churning
up
right
now
There
are
so
many
powerful

and

are
lying

There
are
just
so
many
stains
on
the
history
of
this
belt
that
it
s
hard
to
give
it
a
promising
value
It
was
stripped
from
the
first
two
champions
and
B
J
Penn
s
downfall
hasn
t
exactly
added
value
to
the
legitimacy
of
past
champions
I
would
love
to
see
a
truly
dominant
fighter
get
his
hands
on
this
belt
and
defend
it
for
years
on
end
like
GSP
or
Silva
have
with
their
belts
That
is
about
the
only
way
to
get
the
overall
value
of
this
title
increased
for
all
I
know
Frankie
Edgar
could
be
the
guy
to
take
this
title
up
to
the
80
s
or
90
s
in
value
but
as
it
stands
he
has
to
get
past
Benson
Henderson
first
I
am
going
to
wait
a
few
months
to
evaluate
the
Featherweight
Bantamweight
and
Flyweight
titles
because
their
history
is
just
beginning

Thiago
Alves
had
his
chance
and
blew
it
Regardless
there
was
no
shame
in
losing
a
unanimous
decision
at
UFC
100
to
Georges
St
Pierre
in
his
only
career
title
fight
If
you
ve
been
in
the
170
pound
fray
for
as
long
as
Pitbull
has
chances
are
you
ve
lost
to
the
Canadian
kingpin
too
So
with
St
Pierre
currently
idle
and
interim
champion
Carlos
Condit
patiently
waiting
the
rest
are
free
to
jockey
for
position
and
string
together
title
runs

He
trained

hard

was
really
well

and
the

gone

Perhaps
this
loss
will
be
a

The

I
ve
been
working
on
writing
on
the
road
but
as
far
as
a
sound
I
just
know
it
s
gonna
be
balls
out
irreverent
rock
and
roll
she
said
I
ve
been
pretty
much
in
this
70s
rock
and
roll
kick
and
I
just
want
to
capture
some
of
the
true
essence
of
what
rock
and
roll
is
and
that
s
just
irreverence
and
sexiness
and
fun
and
not
giving
a
f
so
we
ll
definitely
put
a
bit
of
rock
and
roll
in
it
So
does
that
mean
that
fans
can
expect
the
likes
of
Alice
Cooper
or
Peter
Frampton
to
show
up
on
her
new
album
Perhaps
Because
while
Ke
ha
s
new
album
is
still
a
ways
off
she
s
already
begun
calling
in
favors
hoping
to
line
up
a
killer
collabo
for
the
new
disc
I
m
trying
trust
me
she
laughed
I
really
would
love
to
connect
with
one
of
my
idols
I
mean
that
s
my
dream
I
m
working

I
m
here
I
m
here
And
I
saw
my
first
gang
banger
get
arrested
yesterday
so
I
feel
like
a
total
Angeleno
I
m
getting
ready
to
go
to
the
gym
again
like
a
total
Angeleno
so
I
will
update
later
about
my
run
ins
with
Alexander
Skarsgard
Pauly
Shore
and
Jeremy
or
Jason
London
I
m
not
sure
which
one
it
was
and
seeing
if
I
could
force
him
to
do
drugs
to
find
out
seemed
unfair
Besides
as
it
turned
out
he
was
telling
the
truth
Anyhoo
I
ve
got
a
lot
to
tell
you
about
gardening
Did
you
know
if
you
get
dirt
wet
it
turns
into
mud
Yuck
And
bumpers
They
don
t
bump
off
anything
they
go
Scraaaaaaaatch
And
there
s
probably
more
but
again
I
have
to
go
because
I
have
to
get
to
the
gym

I
m
here
I
m
here
And
I
saw
my
first
gang
banger
get
arrested
yesterday
so
I
feel
like
a
total
Angeleno
I
m
getting
ready
to
go
to
the
gym
again
like
a
total
Angeleno
so
I
will
update
later
about
my
run
ins
with
Alexander
Skarsgard
Pauly
Shore
and
Jeremy
or
Jason
London
I
m
not
sure
which
one
it
was
and
seeing
if
I
could
force
him
to
do
drugs
to
find
out
seemed
unfair
Besides
as
it
turned
out
he
was
telling
the
truth
Anyhoo
I
ve
got
a
lot
to
tell
you
about
gardening
Did
you
know
if
you
get
dirt
wet
it
turns
into
mud
Yuck
And
bumpers
They
don
t
bump
off
anything
they
go
Scraaaaaaaatch
And
there
s
probably
more
but
again
I
have
to
go
because
I
have
to
get
to
the
gym

Khlo
and
Lamar
Take
a
Pre
Baby
Trip
to
NYC
Posted
on
October
23
2011
by
admin
As
exclusively
reported
in
the
new
issue
of
In
Touch
Khlo
Kardashian
and
her
husband
Lamar
Odom
have
been
trying
hard
to
expand
their
family
Khlo
s
been
having
a
difficult
time
getting
pregnant
an
insider
explains
Lamar
already
has
kids
so
he
s
not
feeling
the
pressure
but
for
Khlo
it
s
very
consuming
She
s
feeling
a
sense
of
anguish
nearly
all
the
time
However
it
appears
that
Lamar
has
successfully
convinced
his
wife
to
give
herself
a
break
On
October
9
the
pair
were
spotted
having
dinner
with
Kanye
West
and
Sean
Diddy
Combs
at
the
chic
New
York
City
restaurant
The
Darby
Prior
to
their
Columbus
Day
trip
Khlo
and
Lamar
were
mostly
laying
low
in
Los
Angeles
hoping
to
increase
Khlo
s
chance
of
conceiving
through
a
mixture
of
old
fashioned
methods
including
acupuncture
and
high
tech
procedures
The
insider
says
they
intend
to
start
IVF
soon
And
in
an
effort
to
avoid
drama
that
could
drain
her
Khlo
has
been
spending
less
time
with
her
family
But
it
seems
that
a
night
out
with
friends
can
t
do
any
harm
and
there
s
little
worry
of
Khlo
losing
focus
She
s
more
than
ready
to
become
a
mom
a
friend
explains
After
two
years
of
being
Lamar
s
wife
she
feels
the
time
has
come
to
be
his
baby
s
mama

Forrest
Griffin
vs
Tito
Ortiz
III
in
the
works
for
Ortiz
s
final
UFC
fight
Posted

Penick

Editor

Chief
It
appears
Tito
Ortiz
will
indeed
get
his
third
fight
with
Forrest
Griffin
sometime
this
year
a
fight
he
says
will
be
his
last
UFC
owner
Lorenzo
Fertitta
in
the
midst
of
a
lengthy
question
and
answer
session
on
Twitter
early
this
morning
said
that
the
fight
with
Ortiz
would
be
next
for
Griffin
when
asked
by
a
curious
fan
He
didn
t
give
a
date
for
the
fight
but
it
will
come
sometime
in
the
next
several
months
Ortiz
and
Griffin
first
met
back
at
UFC
59
in
2006
At
the
time
Griffin
had
won
three
fights
to
kickstart
his
UFC
career
and
the
bout
with
Ortiz
was
his
first
step
into
the
upper
echelon
of
the
UFC
s
light
heavyweight
division
He
would
lose
that
fight
by
split
decision
but
still
had
a
good
showing
as
he
came
back
from
diversity
and
arguably
took
the
final
two
rounds
of
the
fight
It
would
be
another
three
and
a
half
years
before
they
would
meet
again
this
time
in
the
main
event
of
UFC
106
in
November
of
2009
Ortiz
was
returning
to
the
UFC
after
a
lengthy
hiatus
due
to
a
contract
dispute
and
several
injuries
while
Griffin
had
gone
through
a
roller
coaster
14
months
In
that
stretch
he
had
captured
the
UFC
Light
Heavyweight
Championship
then
lost
it
to
Rashad
Evans
before
getting
blitzed
by
Anderson
Silva
the
summer
before
the
second
meeting
In
that
fight
Griffin
returned
the
split
decision
favor
in
another
close
bout
evening
up
the
series
at
one
apiece
Griffin
has
gone
1
1
since
that
second
meeting
most
recently
losing
to
Mauricio
Shogun
Rua
at
UFC
134
Ortiz
has
gone
1
3
since
that
second
meeting
and
rides
into
his
final
fight
on
a
two
fight
losing
streak
and
his
only
TKO
losses
to
anyone
but
Chuck
Liddell
Penick
s
Analysis
I
m
not
wholly
interested
in
a
third
fight
between
the
two
especially
since
it
doesn
t
mean
much
for
Griffin
in
this
situation
However
as
he
s
not
necessarily
on
his
way
towards
a
title
shot
anytime
soon
this
is
a
marquee
fight
and
a
chance
to
gain
an
advantage
in
the
series
For
Ortiz
it
s
his
one
last
opportunity
to
get
a
win
to
close
out
his
career
and
he
feels
he
can
defeat
Griffin
so
it
s
a
fight
that
makes
sense
to
him

Forgive
me
for
my
next
statement
as
it
could
be
considered
blasphemy
to
some
but
I
actually
thought
last
night
s
RAW
was
far
superior
to
Sunday
night
s
Royal
Rumble
PPV
The
action
was
great
there
were
a
handful
of
nice
twists
turns
the
booking
made
sense
and
a
handful
of
storylines
were
either
progressed
or
developed

Not
that
anyone
asked
but
here
s
how
I
would
handle
the
top
of
the
UFC
welterweight
division
As
it
stands
right
now
Carlos
Condit
is
the
Interim
UFC
Welterweight
Champion
and
Georges
St
Pierre
is
the
full
fledged
UFC
Welterweight
Champion
I
know
I
know
Breaking
news
you
re
welcome
It
s
very
obvious
that
Dana
White
Georges
St
Pierre
and
Nick
Diaz
all
want
to
see
St
Pierre
vs
Diaz
for
the
title
Of
course
Carlos
Condit
went
and
mucked
up
that
plan
by
going
out
there
and
you
know
winning
So
as
a
result
of
that
ever
so
unpleasant
happenstance
we
re
looking
at
Condit
vs
St
Pierre
yawn
or
Condit
versus
Ellenberger
yawn
or
Sanchez
yawn
or
Koscheck
which
might
eventually
lead
to
Koscheck
versus
GSP
III
yawn
or
Hendricks
who
I
mean
yawn
So
what
s
a
promoter
looking
to
make
his
first
dollar
to
do
Let
me
tell
you
a
story
A
true
story
Names
have
been
changed
to
protect
the
innocent
And
the
guilty
In
2007
there
was
a
guy
named
let
s
call
him
Tall
Guy
who
always
wore
this
really
tacky
Shiny
Gold
Belt
every
time
he
went
out
in
public
and
it
totally
didn
t
go
with
any
of
his
shoes
But
Tall
Guy
didn
t
let
that
stop
him
from
wearing
his
twenty
pounds
of
gold
out
to
dinner
contract
signings
and
the
such
Tall
Guy
was
given
this
Shiny
Gold
Belt
by
Rich
Bald
Guy
but
Rich
Bald
Guy
didn
t
expect
to
see
Tall
Guy
wearing
the
damn
thing
with
him
24
hours
a
day
ya
dig
Unfortunately
even
though
Rich
Bald
Guy
technically
owned
the
Shiny
Gold
Belt
he
couldn
t
just
up
and
take
it
back
because
then
the
lawyers
would
get
involved
and
Stan
Marsh
would
yell
shenanigans
and
then
there
would
be
drama
and
attention
and
the
such
Rich
Bald
Guy
needed
a
mercenary
Enter
Old
Guy
Old
Guy
used
to
work
for
Rich
Bald
Guy
but
he
put
himself
out
to
pasture
a
year
prior
Old
Guy
decided
he
could
beat
Tall
Guy
so
Rich
Bald
Guy
was
all
about
that
Old
Guy
beat
up
Tall
Guy
and
Rich
Bald
Guy
gave
Old
Guy
the
Shiny
Gold
Belt
and
all
was
well
with
life
the
universe
and
everything
Hairy
Back
Guy
tried
to
steal
the
Shiny
Gold
Belt
but
failed
miserably
and
all
was
extremely
well
with
life
the
universe
and
everything
Unfortunately
for
Rich
Bald
Guy
and
for
life
the
universe
and
everything
Old
Guy
was
in
fact
a
mercenary
And
being
a
mercenary
one
day
he
told
Rich
Bald
Guy
so
long
and
thanks
for
all
the
fish
and
out
the
door
he
went
With
the
Shiny
Gold
Belt
no
less
Horror
of
horrors
Rich
Bald
Guy
wanted
nothing
more
than
to
get
back
his
Shiny
Gold
Belt
and
if
he
was
able
to
stick
it
to
the
mercenary
Old
Guy
all
the
better
So
he
commissioned
a
goldsmith
to
make
Shiny
Gold
Belt
2
0
and
eventually
he
gave
Shiny
Gold
Belt
2
0
to
Brazilian
Scar
Dude
Rich
Bald
Guy
then
went
out
and
told
the
world
that
Shiny
Gold
Belt
2
0
was
better
than
that
other
Shiny
Gold
Belt
and
Old
Guy
can
stick
it
Irrelevant
side
note
Adrien
Brody
would
look
a
hundred
times
better
if
he
took
that
Gilette
Fusion
Glider
that
he
s
endorsing
and
shaved
the
hell
out
of
his
sideburns
chin
and
upper
lip
as
well
Just
sayin
Back
to
the
story
Old
Guy
knew
his
Shiny
Gold
Belt
was
the
best
Shiny
Gold
Belt
and
he
wanted
to
get
his
hands
on
both
Shiny
Gold
Belts
Apparently
he
d
then
be
able
to
meld
the
two
Shiny
Gold
Belts
into
some
form
of
Super
Belt
with
magic
powers
or
some
such
nonsense
I
don
t
know
whatever
I
m
just
telling
you
what
I
heard
So
Old
Guy
says
to
Rich
Bald
Guy
I
ll
fight
Brazilian
Scar
Dude
and
the
winner
gets
to
wear
both
belts
Deal
So
Rich
Bald
Guy
thought
about
that
offer
for
about
30
seconds
and
remembering
that
his
secondary
goal
was
to
stick
it
to
Old
Guy
he
had
a
message
for
Old
Guy
Rich
Bald
Guy
went
up
to
Old
Guy
and
said
Sorry
Old
Guy
I
think
you
can
beat
Brazilian
Scar
Dude
and
then
what
have
you
learned
from
all
this
Nothing
So
I
told
Brazilian
Scar
Dude
to
show
his
Shiny
Gold
Belt
to
Cocky
Dude
in
December
And
you
know
even
though
I
m
Rich
Bald
Guy
it
s
not
like
I
can
just
change
things
with
at
the
snap
of
my
fingers
at
which
point
they
say
Rich
Bald
guy
busted
out
laughing
for
like
ten
minutes
straight
So
how
about
you
hang
out
with
Scandinavian
Donkey
Kong
Man
in
November
and
maybe
just
maybe
he
won
t
rip
the
Shiny
Gold
Belt
from
your
cold
dead
hands
Feeling
he
had
no
choice
Old
Guy
walked
into
a
room
with
Scandinavian
Donkey
Kong
Man
and
gave
the
original
Shiny
Gold
Belt
to
Scandinavian
Donkey
Kong
Man
Eventually
Scandinavian
Donkey
Kong
Man
and
Cocky
Dude
went
through
with
that
whole
melding
of
the
Shiny
Gold
Belts
thing
and
Shiny
Gold
Belt
2
0
seems
to
have
disappeared
So
what
s
the
point
How
does
this
tie
in
to
the
current
UFC
Welterweight
mess
Simple
Let
Condit
or
anyone
who
might
beat
Condit
defend
the
interim
title
as
many
times
as
he
needs
to
until
GSP
is
ready
to
return
Make
sure
that
GSP
returns
at
a
time
when
Condit
or
whoever
is
the
Interim
champion
at
that
time
is
already
booked
Then
just
book
the
fight
you
want
to
book
GSP
vs
Diaz
for
the
real
title
winner
faces
the
interim
champion
Is
it
really
that
complicated

years

TMZ
cites
sources
who
say
Jesse
was
transported
to
a
local
hospital
and
pronounced
dead
a
short
time
after
his
body
was
discovered
He
passed
away
from
a
suspected
overdose
as
the
coroner
has
ruled
out
foul
play
In
response
to
the
tragedy
the
Farrelly
family

includes
fellow
director
Peter
pictured

with
Bobby
released
a
statement
that
reads
It
is
with
profound
sorrow
that
we
accept
the
passing
of
our
beloved
Jesse
following
his
struggle
with
addiction
We
fully
trust
that
he
is
now
in
the
hands
of
our
Lord
We
are
immeasurably
grateful
for
the
abundance
of
happiness
and
laughter
he
brought
into
our
lives
and
we
will
rejoice
eternally
for
all
the
moments
we
got
to
breathe
in
his
wondrous
spirit
The
family
thanks
you
for
your
well
wishes
and
kindly
asks
that
you
respect
our
privacy
during
this
difficult
time

Benedict
has
got
this
intensity
about
him
actor
tells
MTV
News
about
new
Trek
villain
By
Kara
Warner
Chris
Pine

Given
the
overwhelming
success
of
J
J
Abrams
Star
Trek
much
ado
has
been
made
over
the
sequel
which
started
production
not
too
long
ago
One
of
the
more
interesting
stories
to
come
out
of
the
flurry
of
activity
surrounding
the
new
film
is
the
casting
of
rising
star
Benedict
Cumberbatch
as
the
chief
villain
The
very
busy
actor
could
only
express
his
excitement
about
the
project
when
MTV
News
caught
up
with
him
at
the
Golden
Globes
but
co
star
Chris
Pine
had
a
little
bit
more
to
offer
about
Cumberbatch
s
contributions
to
the
film
thus
far
Benedict
is
fantastic
He
s
just
so
good
Pine
told
MTV
about
his
scenes
with
the
British
actor
at
the
premiere
of
This
Means
War
He
s
super
talented
and
we
are
more
than
grateful
to
have
him
onboard
When
asked
about
the
tone
of
his
scenes
with
the
Tinker
Tailor
Soldier
Spy
and
War
Horse
actor
Pine
gushed
about
his
co
star
s
acting
skills
Benedict
has
got
this
intensity
about
him
and
he
s
obviously
extremely
intelligent
and
articulate
His
vocal
quality
is
something
else
He
obviously
is
unlike
many
of
us
like
an
actually
trained
actor
Pine
added
with
a
laugh
He
actually
studied
for
it
So
what
are
we
going
to
love
about
Cumberbatch
s
performance
And
will
it
be
love
hate
since
he
s
playing
a
mysterious
villain
You
ll
love
everything
He
s
really
talented
Pine
said
I
think
it
s
all
going
to
be
love
a
mad
amount
of
love
Another
Star
Trek
2
actor
Alice
Eve
was
just
as
excited
about
Cumberbatch
joining
the
team
having
worked
with
him
previously
on
Starter
for
10
I
m
very
excited
to
work
with
him
again
He
s
so
very
funny
Ben
she
said
I
don
t
know
if
you
remember
his
character
in
Starter
for
10
but
he
was
so
funny
Like
King
of
the
Geeks
but
he
did
it
so
well
and
I
found
a
lot
of
that
hard
to
get
through
because
he
was
so
funny
I
like
him
very
much

got

Grateful
For
Benedict

Benedict
has
got
this
intensity
about
him
actor
tells
MTV
News
about
new
Trek
villain
By
Kara
Warner
Chris
Pine
Photo
Dominique
Charriau
WireImage
Given
the
overwhelming
success
of
J
J
Abrams
Star
Trek
much
ado
has
been
made
over
the
sequel
which
started
production
not
too
long
ago
One
of
the
more
interesting
stories
to
come
out
of
the
flurry
of
activity
surrounding
the
new
film
is
the
casting
of
rising
star
Benedict
Cumberbatch
as
the
chief
villain
The
very
busy
actor
could
only
express
his
excitement
about
the
project
when
MTV
News
caught
up
with
him
at
the
Golden
Globes
but
co
star
Chris
Pine
had
a
little
bit
more
to
offer
about
Cumberbatch
s
contributions
to
the
film
thus
far
Benedict
is
fantastic
He
s
just
so
good
Pine
told
MTV
about
his
scenes
with
the
British
actor
at
the
premiere
of
This
Means
War
He
s
super
talented
and
we
are
more
than
grateful
to
have
him
onboard
When
asked
about
the
tone
of
his
scenes
with
the
Tinker
Tailor
Soldier
Spy
and
War
Horse
actor
Pine
gushed
about
his
co
star
s
acting
skills
Benedict
has
got
this
intensity
about
him
and
he
s
obviously
extremely
intelligent
and
articulate
His
vocal
quality
is
something
else
He
obviously
is
unlike
many
of
us
like
an
actually
trained
actor
Pine
added
with
a
laugh
He
actually
studied
for
it
So
what
are
we
going
to
love
about
Cumberbatch
s
performance
And
will
it
be
love
hate
since
he
s
playing
a
mysterious
villain
You
ll
love
everything
He
s
really
talented
Pine
said
I
think
it
s
all
going
to
be
love
a
mad
amount
of
love
Another
Star
Trek
2
actor
Alice
Eve
was
just
as
excited
about
Cumberbatch
joining
the
team
having
worked
with
him
previously
on
Starter
for
10
I
m
very
excited
to
work
with
him
again
He
s
so
very
funny
Ben
she
said
I
don
t
know
if
you
remember
his
character
in
Starter
for
10
but
he
was
so
funny
Like
King
of
the
Geeks
but
he
did
it
so
well
and
I
found
a
lot
of
that
hard
to
get
through
because
he
was
so
funny
I
like
him
very
much

everything
we
ve
got
on

Do
you
think
Conrad
Murray
deserved
the
maximum
sentence
Let
us
know
on
Facebook
b
a
Along
with
Katherine
Michael
s
siblings
LaToya
Jermaine
Randy
and
Rebbie
were
also
reportedly
in
attendance
at
the
hearing
In
regards
to
the
sentence
the
family
said
in
the
statement
We
respectfully
request
you
impose
a
sentence
that
reminds
physicians
they
cannot
sell
their
services
to
the
highest
bidder
The
judge
agreed
lamenting
that
due
to
a
new
California
law
to
address
overcrowding
in
prisons
he
was
unable
to
sentence
Murray
to
state
prison
Stating
that
Murray
practiced
horrible
medicine
and
had
absolutely
no
remorse
Judge
Michael
Pastor
declined
the
defense
s
motion
for
probation
and
handed
down
the
stiffest
sentence
possible
8212
four
years
8212
which
Murray
will
most
likely
serve
in
a
Los
Angeles
county
jail
or
on
home
confinement
Upon
leaving
the
courthouse
Michael
s
brother
Jermaine
when
asked
if
the
four
year
sentence
was
enough
shook
his
head
and
said
No
Katherine
told
local
TV
station
KTLA
Four
years
is
not
enough
for
someone
s
life
It
won
t
bring
him
back
But
at
least
he
got
the
maximum
and
I
thought
the
judge
was
very
very
fair

Four

It

But
at

to

her
new
book
about

her
findings
to

s

THE
GOOD
NEWS
CLUB
The
Christian
Right
s
Stealth
Assault
on
America
s
Children
is
a
powerful
study
of
religious
right
activity
in
public
schools
Michelle
Goldberg
author
of
Kingdom
Coming
The
Rise
of
Christian
Nationalism
and
The
Means
of
Reproduction
says
Even
those
well
versed
in
the
religious
right
s
attempt
to
Christianize
American
institutions
will
likely
be
shocked
by
The
Good
News
Club
Katherine
Stewart
s
book
about
the
fundamentalist
assault
on
public
education
is
lucid
alarming
and
very
important
In
January
2009
Katherine
Stewart
learned
that
the
Santa
Barbara
public
elementary
school
her
children
attended
had
added
a
Bible
study
class
called
the
Good
News
Club
to
its
afterschool
program
Stewart
s
curiosity
turned
to
concern
as
she
discovered
that
the
unstated
purpose
of
the
club
which
is
sponsored
by
the
Child
Evangelism
Fellowship
is
to
convey
the
impression
to
its
young
members
and
their
schoolmates
that
their
school
favors
a
particular
form
of
the
Christian
religion
She
soon
learned
that
the
Good
News
Club
a
seemingly
spontaneous
and
voluntary
after
school
program
was
in
fact
part
of
a
larger
calculated
initiative
by
national
advocacy
groups
whose
declared
aim
is
to
take
back
America
s
public
schools
and
repurpose
them
with
a
Fundamentalist
Christian
agenda
What
happened
in
Stewart
s
community
is
happening
nationwide
At
the
end
of
2010
there
were
nearly
3
500
Good
News
Clubs
operating
in
public
schools
across
the
country
a
number
that
is
rapidly
increasing
and
the
Good
News
Club
is
just
one
of
many
different
initiatives
with
similar
goals
What
s
more
a
landmark
2001
Supreme
Court
ruling
not
only
permits
such
an
entanglement
between
schools
and
religion
it
effectively
makes
it
obligatory
In
The
Good
News
Club
The
Christian
Right
s
Stealth
Assault
on
America
s
Children
Stewart
sets
out
on
an
investigative
journey
to
uncover
the
effect
the
Good
News
Clubs
and
similar
initiatives
have
on
our
schools
children
and
communities
She
travels
to
dozens
of
cities
and
towns
across
the
country
and
visits
regions
famous
for
their
piety
like
west
Texas
and
Alabama
as
well
as
places
known
for
the
opposite
like
Seattle
and
New
York
City
Everywhere
she
discovers
religion
driven
programs
inserting
themselves
into
public
school
systems
with
unprecedented
force
and
unexpected
consequences
Stewart
takes
us
on
a
chilling
narrative
in
which
she
Interviews
members
of
a
community
in
Seattle
that
has
been
torn
apart
by
the
arrival
of
a
Good
News
Club
in
their
public
school
Goes
undercover
to
sit
in
on
training
sessions
with
instructors
for
the
Good
News
Club
which
arms
its
local
club
leaders
with
The
Plan
a
document
hundreds
of
pages
in
length
that
details
each
step
involved
in
setting
up
and
maintaining
a
club
including
instructions
on
how
to
serve
legal
papers
to
a
resistant
superintendent
and
how
to
incentivize
unchurched
children
to
attend
meetings
Visits
student
athletic
programs
that
have
been
turned
into
vehicles
for
religious
recruiting
Listens
to
the
stories
of
children
who
have
been
subject
to
proselytizing
in
classrooms
and
school
yards
and
speaks
with
other
children
who
have
been
instructed
to
proselytize
their
friends
at
school
Meets
with
school
board
officials
who
are
busy
rewriting
textbook
standards
to
conform
to
their
own
religious
agendas
Interviews
the
people
promoting
and
attending
Bible
Study
courses
that
turn
out
to
be
programs
of
sectarian
indoctrination
In
The
Good
News
Club
Stewart
details
how
the
labor
behind
the
initiatives
may
be
local
but
the
ideas
the
money
and
the
legal
firepower
that
make
them
possible
are
national
The
movement
is
coordinated
and
given
strategic
direction
by
extremely
well
financed
groups
whose
leaders
write
the
scripts
that
are
followed
in
classrooms
playgrounds
and
courtrooms
from
New
York
to
California
Some
of
the
most
powerful
forces
in
public
education
today
are
groups
that
most
people
may
never
have
heard
of
the
Alliance
Defense
Fund
ADF
the
Liberty
Counsel
the
American
Center
for
Law
and
Justice
ACLJ
and
other
conservative
legal
groups
that
with
combined
budgets
totaling
over
100
million
per
year
have
masterminded
the
religious
assault
on
public
education
Today
Stewart
concludes
there
is
more
religious
activity
in
American
public
schools
than
there
has
been
for
the
past
100
years
The
Christian
Right
s
strategy
to
take
back
America
is
stealthy
calculated
extremely
well
financed
and
coming
soon
to
a
neighborhood
near
you
And
it
has
our
children
our
schools
and
our
future
in
its
sights
Knock
down
all
of
the
doors
all
of
the
barriers
to
all
of
the
65
000
plus
elementary
schools
in
the
country
and
take
the
gospel
to
this
open
mission
field
now
Not
later
Now

Year
Of
The
Bible
Pennsylvania
House
Urges
Faith
In
God
Through
Holy
Scripture
By
Ed
Joyce
on
February
6
2012
Earlier
this
week
the
House
of
Representatives
approved
H
R
535
a
nonbinding
resolution
designating
2012
the
Year
of
the
Bible
Introduced
by
Rep
Rick
Saccone
R
Elizabeth
Township
and
36
other
legislators
the
measure
insists
that
biblical
teachings
inspired
concepts
of
civil
government
that
are
contained
in
our
Declaration
of
Independence
and
the
Constitution
of
the
United
States
This
resolution
sends
a
clear
message
to
residents
that
the
state
favors
Christianity
and
it
thus
violates
the
spirit
of
the
First
Amendment
of
the
U
S
Constitution
It
also
runs
afoul
of
Section
3
of
the
Pennsylvania
State
Constitution
which
states
no
preference
shall
ever
be
given
by
law
to
any
religious
establishments
or
modes
of
worship
Section
3
makes
it
crystal
clear
that
Pennsylvania
s
early
representatives
recognized
the
importance
of
keeping
church
and
state
separated
and
intended
government
to
remain
neutral
with
respect
to
religion
This
resolution
is
also
alienating
and
will
have
the
effect
of
informing
non
Christians
they
are
little
more
than
second
class
citizens
According
to
data
from
2000
the
Penn
State
University
s
Association
of
Religion
Data
Archives
shows
that
Pennsylvania
s
population
was
12
281
054
Of
these
8
448
193
were
estimated
to
belong
to
some
sort
of
organized
religion
with
about
422
000
being
non
Christian
This
leaves
around
4
million
residents
whose
religious
affiliations
are
unknown
A
2011
Gallup
Poll
found
that
7
of
Americans
claim
to
be
atheist
which
is
similar
to
other
studies
Using
7
as
a
very
conservative
approximation
means
that
of
the
4
million
whose
religious
affiliations
are
unknown
about
280
000
can
be
considered
atheist
These
data
suggest
there
are
over
700
000
non
Christian
and
atheist
Pennsylvania
residents
who
probably
do
not
agree
with
H
R
535
Added
to
this
number
would
be
all
the
Christians
who
also
do
not
believe
that
a
majority
religion
should
be
forced
upon
non
Christians
Many
Christians
solemnly
believe
that
religion
is
a
personal
endeavor
and
religious
edicts
should
not
be
heralded
from
our
state
houses
If
church
state
separation
means
anything
at
all
it
ought
to
stand
for
the
proposition
that
government
stays
out
of
religion
Many
Americans
believe
in
the
Bible
but
many
don
t
It
s
not
the
business
of
the
Pennsylvania
House
to
make
overt
religious
proclamations
It
s
a
shame
that
the
House
has
turned
its
back
on
our
admirable
tradition
of
government
neutrality
with
respect
to
religion
and
sent
a
message
of
intolerance
to
those
who
do
not
share
the
majority
faith

A

Pennsylvania
Legislators

objection
to
House
Resolution

the
Year
of
the
Bible
resolution

views
To
Representative
Lawrence
Curry
Senator
Vincent
Hughes
and
Congresswoman
Allyson
Schwartz
I
am
deeply
concerned
about
the
recent
Pennsylvania
General
Assembly
s
passage
of
House
Resolution
No
535
passed
unanimously
on
January
24
2012
House
Resolution
No
535
declares
the
year
of
2012
to
be
the
Year
of
the
Bible
in
the
State
of
Pennsylvania
This
resolution
was
introduced
as
noncontroversial
and
deals
with
the
Separation
of
Church
and
State
issue
I
was
flabbergasted
it
was
labeled
noncontroversial
given
the
recent
events
in
California
Rhode
Island
and
right
here
in
Pennsylvania
over
the
last
few
months
I
view
this
as
a
cowardly
and
possibly
illegal
way
to
pass
backdoor
legislation
with
the
sole
purpose
of
laying
the
groundwork
to
make
Pennsylvania
a
State
Theocracy
for
the
Christian
Religion
More
troubling
was
the
lack
of
one
dissenting
voice
for
a
resolution
that
is
wrought
with
errors
and
violates
not
only
the
Pennsylvania
State
Constitution
but
the
Constitution
of
United
States
of
America
The
state
legislature
has
no
right
to
declare
any
religious
text
the
word
of
God
for
Pennsylvanians
This
state
nor
this
nation
is
all
Christian
There
are
other
religious
and
life
choices
including
but
not
limited
to
Judaism
Islam
Mormon
Universal
Unitarian
Scientology
Eastern
philosophy
humanist
deist
and
pagan
All
have
their
own
belief
systems
and
moral
guidelines
The
Gen
Assembly
has
demonstrated
a
complete
lack
of
understanding
of
the
principles
of
the
Declaration
of
Independence
and
the
history
of
Pennsylvania

We
are
very
fortunate
to
have
Attorney
Paul
Grosswald

Attorney
Grosswald

in
a
landmark
Supreme
Court
case
involving
the
reciting
of
the
Pledge
of
Allegiance
in
a
public
school
Mr
Grosswald
will
discuss
the
arguments
he
presented
to
the
Supreme
Court
He
will
also
provide
an
update
on
new
Pledge
of
Allegiance
decisions
that
have
been
handed
down
since
2004
At
the
conclusiong
of
his
talk
he
will
lead
a
discussion
regarding
the
best
strategy
for
church
state
separationists
going
forward
Is
it
wise
for
Mr
Newdow
to
continue
bringing
separation
cases
which
are
likely
to
be
lost
in
front
of
the
current
Supreme
Court
Or
would
it
be
better
if
he
waited
until
the
makeup
of
the
Court
changes
before
pursuing
a
separationist
agenda
Come
join
us
for
an
informative
and
lively
discussion
Title
One
Nation
Indivisible
Speaker
Paul
S
Grosswald
graduated
magna
cum
laude
from
Brooklyn
Law
School
in
2001
He
specializes
in
civil
rights
and
employment
discrimination
cases
He
is
admitted
in
New
York
and
New
Jersey
and
in
numerous
federal
courts
including
the
Supreme
Court
of
the
United
States
Abstract
In
2004
attorney
Paul
S
Grosswald
became
involved
in
one
of
the
most
controversial
Establishment
Clause
cases
ever
to
reach
the
United
States
Supreme
Court
Michael
Newdow
s
daughter
s
school
district
had
a
policy
requiring
the
school
to
lead
students
in
a
daily
recitation
of
the
Pledge
of
Allegiance
Newdow
sued
the
school
district
on
the
grounds
that
such
a
policy
violates
the
Establishment
Clause
of
the
United
States
Constitution
because
the
Pledge
contains
the
phrase
Under
God
Newdow
prevailed
in
the
Ninth
Circuit
Court
of
Appeals
and
the
Supreme
Court
agreed
to
hear
the
case
Mr
Grosswald
entered
the
case
early
in
2004
when
he
co
authored
a
Friend
of
the
Court
Brief
on
behalf
of
a
coalition
of
Buddhist
Organizations
with
a
combined
membership
of
over
300
000
Buddhist
Americans
Mr
Grosswald
s
brief
supported
Newdow
s
position
that
the
school
district
s
Pledge
policy
was
unconstitutional
Ultimately
the
Court
ruled
against
Newdow
on
procedural
grounds
without
addressing
the
Under
God
issue
Nevertheless
three
Justices
issued
concurring
opinions
which
squarely
addressed
the
constitutionality
of
the
school
district
s
Pledge
policy
One
of
those
opinions
written
by
Justice
Sandra
Day
O
Connor
cited

Grosswald

Gloria

s
Review
of
Paul
Grosswald
June
1
Chapter
Meeting
By
Ed
Joyce
on
June
2
2010
I
wanted
to
publicly
thank
the
the
new
Delaware
Valley
Bucks
County
Chapter
of
AU
for
an
incredible
program
last
night
Paul
Grosswald
Esq
who
wrote
the
amicus
brief
on
the
part
of
the
Buddhists
explained
the
nuances
and
lack
thereof
of
the
Newdow
case
His
humor
and
ability
to
walk
us
through
the
case
one
step
at
a
time
brought
home
the
extent
that
the
1954
addition
of
under
G
d
in
the
pledge
violates
the
First
amendment
The
purpose
of
the
addition
is
clear
to
teach
children
from
a
young
age
that
loyalty
to
country
is
synonymous
with
loyalty
to
G
d
It
clearly
endorses
one
religion
over
another
as
to
a
Buddhist
every
recitation
of
the
pledge
violates
his
duty
to
right
speech
and
as
a
public
school
teacher
I
can
attest
that
in
some
classes
students
are
coerced
into
saying
the
pledge
What
I
never
fathomed
before
was
how
the
other
side
could
defend
under
G
d
in
the
pledge
constitutionally
The
answer
was
clear
by
the
end
of
the
presentation
They
don
t
Some
of
the
arguments
was
that
the
phrase
acknowledged
limited
government
remember
the
Declaration
is
NOT
the
Constitution
it
Promotes
Patriotism
commemorates
the
role
of
religion
in
American
History
that
will
be
included
in
the
Texas
SS
textbooks
I
m
sure
and
we
need
to
look
at
the
pledge
in
its
entirety
as
most
of
it
is
not
about
G
d
None
of
these
reasons
really
argues
why
the
courts
support
Congress
s
inclusion
of
under
G
d
in
the
1954
revision
of
the
pledge
and
it
is
still
held
Constitutional
In
2008
Sarah
Palin
was
asked
Are
you
offended
by
the
phrase
Under
God
in
the
Pledge
of
Allegiance
Why
or
why
not
Her
reply
is
disturbing
for
those
of
us
who
believe
in
teaching
history
accurately
Not
on
your
life
If
it
was
good
enough
for
the
founding
fathers
its
good
enough
for
me
and
I
ll
fight
in
defense
of
our
Pledge
of
Allegiance
Mr
Grosswald
believes
in
teaching
history
accurately
and
he
believes
in
the
Constitution
The
Pledge
wasn
t
written
until
1892
and
the
revision
of
adding
under
G
d
was
not
made
until
1954
Possibly
it
is
time
to
revisit
the
historical
precedent
of
reciting
the
pledge
in
its
present
form
Thank
you
to
Mr
Grosswald
for
traveling
to
Doylestown
to
give
a
brilliant
lecture
and
thank
you
to
Ed
and
AU
for
arranging
an
enlightening
program
that
was
so
well
delivered

We
are
delighted
to
announce
that
as
part
of
the
Heroes
of
the
Mobile
Fringe
Festival
in
Barcelona
there
will
be
a
number
of
expert
Drop
in
Surgeries
on
offer
At
our
core
we
want
to
help
young
companies
benefit
from
expertise
to
grow
and
scale
their
business
that
they
might
not
ordinarily
have
access
to
We
have
a
number
of
experts
available
and
we
would
like
to
offer
you
the
opportunity
to
have
these
sessions
staffed
at
your
stands
meetings
rooms
or
at
your
events
all
you
need
is
two
chairs
and
a
quiet
ish
spot
Sessions
are
about
20
to
25
minutes
long
and
intended
to
run
as
pop
ups
so
those
passing
can
stop
and
seek
advice
as
they
wander
around
too
We
will
be
promoting
these
sessions
through
the
festival
and
our
experts
own
networks
We
think
this
will
create
an
additional
useful
attraction
for
your
stand
or
event
What
s
more
some
of
our
experts
will
be
producing
blog
posts
summarising
the
advice
that
they
gave
during
their
sessions
which
as
a
session
host
you
can
publish
or
link
to
as
well
We
will
be
opening
up
registrations
for
these
sessions
shortly
but
first
we
need
some
space
to
do
them
There
s
no
charge
to
lend
us
some
of
your
exhibition
space
so
it
s
a
very
easy
way
for
you
to
get
involved
with
the
festival
Does
that
sound
like
you
Or
maybe
you
re
an
expert
who
d
like
to
offer
some
free
consultancy
sessions
to
SMEs
and
start
ups
To
give
you
an
example

expertise

Yes
it
s
that
time
of
year
again
when
we
all
descend
on
Barcelona
for
Mobile
World
Congress
And
this
lunch
which
forms
part
of
the
inaugural
Heroes
of
the
Mobile
Fringe
Festival
is
a
chance
for
us
ladies
to
get
together
for
an
hour
or
so
over
a
relaxed
lunch
and
chew
the
fat
with
our
peers
away
from
the
main
drag
Priority
will
be
given
to
ladies
to
attend
If
there
s
room
then
we
ll
be
able
to
have
some
gentlemen
join
us
too
However
we
are
very
limited
in
space
Venue
is
to
be
confirmed
but
likely
to
be
the
same
one
we
had
last
year
which
is
a
tapas
restaurant
about
5
minutes
walk
from
the
main
entrance
to
La
Fira
We
ll
update
you
as
soon
as
we
can
on
the
location
The
lunch
starts
at
12
30
and
will
finish
at
14
30
If
you
re
interested
in
joining
us
please
confirm
your
place
here
We
re
taking
payment
in
advance
to
cover
costs
and
is
25
Euro
per
head
a
small
fee
for
eventbrite
That
s
because
we
need
to
pay
for
the
food
in
advance
The
lunch
will
be
a
range
of
tapas
to
share
with
soft
drinks
provided
Wine
and
additional
dishes
can
be
ordered
on
the
day
Payment

bank

you
with
the
details
Do

friends
and
look
forward
to
seeing
you

less
frantic

be

Having
CMMS
Having
CMMS
by
Curt
Dunkley
If
you
can
successfully
control
and
oversee
your
facilities
you
are
taking
the
biggest
step
toward
making
a
profit
To
actually
handle
all
the
tasks
that
come
at
you
though
is
quite
difficult
to
pull
off
The
best
managers
will
be
able
to
find
the
right
mix
of
outgoing
cost
and
income
If
you
re
looking
for
a
way
to
put
your
inventory
tracking
on
autopilot
you
won
t
find
a
much
better
program
than
a
computerized
maintenance
management
system
A
computerized
maintenance
management
system
works
to
both
calculate
and
observe
how
the
costs
of
payroll
mechanical
maintenance
and
other
capital
are
matching
up
with
your
projected
budget
Your
clients
and
stockholders
will
be
happy
with
the
CMMS
as
well
since
the
program
can
also
help
keep
track
of
both
quality
control
and
your
liability
reports
both
of
which
can
contribute
to
customer
complaints
and
unnecessary
financial
losses
A
computerized
maintenance
management
system
will
serve
many
functions

What
is

VPS
Technology
What
is
a
Virtual
Private
Server
by
Yue
Wang
Many
people
believe
that
VPS
hosting
is
the
greatest
solution
for
a
company
s
hosting
needs
but
it
may
be
that
your
understanding
of
VPS
hosting
is
in
need
of
bolstering
or
strengthening
A
great
number
of
web
site
owners
would
agree
with
this
need
for
further
knowledge
but
VPS
hosting
is
something
you
can
develop
your
skills
in
This
is
why
many
people
try
to
take
time
to
learn
about
what
a
Virtual
Private
Server
actually
does
The
simple
issue
of
a
VPS
hosting
solution
is
how
it
stands
a
shared
hosting
answer
or
a
dedicated
hosting
answer
This
ensures
that
if
a
shared
hosting
option
is
lacking
but
a
dedicated
hosting
option
is
too
expensive
help
can
be
found
VPS
hosting
is
the
optimum
package
for
many
individuals
and
the
benefits
of
VPS
technology
are
the
key
factor
in
that
outcome
People
that
want
products
such
as
custom
firewalls
dedicated
IP
addresses
or
SSH
access
will
realise
that
VPS
hosting
is
the
most
sensible
purchase
for
their
requirements
The
ability
to
customize
on
a
VPS
host
is
a
major
bonus
for
any
individual
There
is
a
pleasing
value
for
money
result
from
settling
for
VPS
hosting
solutions
VPS
is
not
too
difficult
a
process
to
learn
about
and
it
can
be
compared
to
an
individual
part
of
a
real
server
This
server
is
broken
down
and
separated
into
an
array
of
different
sections
with
an
individual
section
hosting
its
own
operating
systems
RAM
bandwidth
and
even
disk
space
This
leads
to
a
hosting
company
being
able
to
provide
a
varied
number
of
VPS
packages
from
one
actual
server
Each
website
owner
including
a
VPS
hosting
company
if
they
have
bought
this
package
is
handed
their
own
space
and
will
only
receive
access
to
their
sector
Web
hosts
have
the
right
to
install
programmes
on
this
component
as
they
decide
allowing
to
take
full
control
of
their
server

Talk
A
day
In
the
Life
Of
A
Lawyer
by
Christine
Jackson
A
lawyer
is
a
person
who
s
authorized
by
the
state
or
nation
to
practice
law
give
advice
to
his
or
her
clients
and
represent
their
legal
matters
in
the
courts
According
to
classes
or
ranks
of
jurists
lawyers
may
be
designated
as
advocate
lawyer
barrister
counselor
and
solicitor
A
lawyer
has
to
study
law
and
new
laws
on
a
regular
basis
to
stay
as
much
as
date
to
be
able
to
protect
their
clients
This
really
is
the
fundamentals
of
a
profession
in
law
protecting
your
client
s
freedoms
and
rights
Each
day
In
the
Life
Of
A
Lawyer
1
Get
ready
to
travel
Lawyers
spend
most
of
their
time
in
offices
and
courtrooms
They
travel
to
meet
their
clients
wherever
they
re
and
houses
company
locations
even
emergency
rooms
in
hospitals
and
state
or
federal
prisons
can
be
a
fairly
normal
visit
depending
on
which
region
in
the
law
a
lawyer
is
involved
They
also
travel
different
locations
for
meetings
and
to
gather
proof
or
evidence
for
their
case
that
they
are
able
to
submit
towards
the
courts
legislative
bodies
or
to
other
high
authorities
in
the
law
two
Irregular
work
hours
may
be
the
norm
Lawyers
quite
often
have
irregular
function
schedules
and
even
work
for
several
hours
in
discussing
with
customers
or
preparing
the
briefs
in
the
case
during
non
office
hours
3
Back
to
the
studying
board
A
lawyer
is
also
referred
to
as
an
attorney
who
acts
each
as
an
advocate
and
an
advisor
in
society
The
advocates
represent
certainly
one
of
their
clients
in
criminal
or
civil
trials
by
arguing
and
presenting
evidence
towards
the
court
to
protect
their
client
However
the
advisors
give
advice
to
their
customers
concerning
their
business
and
legal
individual
matters
All
of
the
lawyers
whether
or
not
an
advocate
or
an
advisor
need
to
study
the
purpose
of
laws
and
judicial
choices
to
apply
them
within
the
critical
circumstances
faced
by
their
customers
The
most
essential
aspect
is
the
fact
that
a
lawyer
s
job
depends
extremely
a
lot
upon
his
or
her
own
field
of
specialization
and
position
All
this
demands
continual
studying
Kinds
of
Lawyers
You
will
find
allot
of
locations
to
specialize
in
as
a
lawyer
This
list
isn
t
exhaustive
but
covers
some
of
the
most
popular
fields

will
be
able
to
specialize
into
if

Chairs
by
Warren
Harmon
Perhaps

how
you
spend
time
for
yourself
with
your
ex
girlfriend
ones
Let
us
count
the
ways
using
Love
Sacks
for
adults
and
children
that
exist
in
the
market
You

find
goods
that
accommodate
1
A

a
kid
that

4
feet
For
teens
who

sit
and
play
game
titles
3
feet

and
1
foot
high
bean
bags
can
give
them
the
trunk
support
to
get
a
comfortable
position
so
that
they
cope
with
each
amount
of
the
game
effectively
Love
Sacks
also
offers
the
answer
for
your
tiny
spaces
Manufacturers
know
that
a
grownup
would
also
want
to
benefit
from
the
comfort
that
the
bean
bag
provides
Manufacturers
feel
that
in
one
corner
of
the
every
room
4
feet
wide
and
a
pair
of
5
feet
high
bean
bag
would
sit
perfectly
Beanbags

you
share
You

designs
that

accommodate
two
to
three
adult
individuals
The
bean
bag

the
purpose
can
be

Varying

pounds
Yes
by
using
these
dimension
there
isn
t
any
cause
never
to
share
and
enjoy
the
chair
with
family
or
friends
There
exists
a
beanbag
sort
very
similar
to
a
double
bed
that
weighs
about
35
pounds
It
feels
safe
by
sitting
on
but
is
more
relaxing
as
a
result
of
rocker
frame
Some
packages
enable
you
to
get
this
Love
Sacks
item
with
pillows
and
blanket
Have
you

a
minimum
of
5
methods
to
experience
true
comfort
and
relaxation
regardless
if
you
are
alone
or
with
pals
All
these
are
possible
due
to
the
premium
shredded
durafoam
that
s
in
each
one
of
the
bean
bag
chairs
bearing
the
guarantee
that
it
ll
in
no
way
go
flat
break
or
even
tear
Much
more
items
to
know
will
be
the
materials
for
that
beanbag
covers
The
fabrics
are
constructed
with
different
supplies
that
are
machine
washable
so
cleaning
becomes
easy
The
Love
Sacks
come
in
different
styles
and
packages
you
may
love
You
may
have
a
plain
circular
beanbag
There
are
the
ones
that
have
a
beverage
holder
along
with
a
tube
pillow
Nevertheless
some
come
with
an
ottoman
kind
of
bean
bag
that
becomes
section
of
the
package
Every
thing
about
bean
bag
chairs
can
be
a
item
of
cautious
thinking
To
count
the
methods
to
provide
a
customer
is
satisfaction
that

continually
count
over
time
ahead

The
Definitions
of
Fire
Glass
When
standard
untreated
glass
comes
into
contact
with
elevated
temperatures
and
the
intense
pressure
due
to
a
fire
it
will
more
frequently
than
not
buckle
under
the
extreme
pressure
and
will
crack
or
shatter
completely
and
in
some
cases
explode
If
this
glass
were
to
be
part
of
a
door
it
could
be
devastating
for
the
inhabitants
of
a
building
as
the
shattering
glass
could
cause
injury
to
person
and
property
There
s
also
the
extra
danger
that
any
crack
in
the
tumbler
of
a
door
could
cause
the
door
which
would
be
otherwise
providing
an
insulating
barrier
against
flames
or
smoke
to
lose
its
integrity
and
let
damaging
fire
thru
where
it
d
cause
harm
or
just
allow
smoke
to
go
through
the
frame
and
cause
damage
to
person
and
property
Specifically
Treated
Glass
For
reasons
of
private
and
property
safety
as
well
as
the
law
which
rules
public
safety
and
building
and
business
owners
as
a
part
of
health
and
safety
regulation
as
well
as
the
Regulatory
Reform
Fire
Safety
Order
2006
it
s
important
that
any
doors
can
withstand
fire
It
stands
to
reason
that
any
glass
which
is
utilized
in
doors
especially
those
which
are
labelled
and
classed
as
fire
doors
with
glass
have
received
special
treatment
and
are
able
to
bear
the
effects
of
a
fire
however
serious
it
could
be
When
it
is
considered
that
untreated
glass
can
bear
temperatures
of
nearly
200c
whilst
tempered
glass
can
withstand
500f
and
fireproof
glass
is
able
to
put
up
with
temperatures
up
to
1600f
it
is
no
wonder
that
home
and
business
owners
favor
safety
as
well
as
adhering
to
their
legal
necessities
when
it
comes
to
purchasing
fire
doors
with
glass
How
is
Glass
Treated
There
are
a
bunch
of
ways
that
glass
can
be
dealt
with
to
give
it
the
abilities
which
would
be
needed
to
allow
it
to
stand
up
to
the
high
temperature
and
pressure
which
can
often
be
made
by
a
fire
Given
the
temperature
of
a
fire
can
rise
significantly
inside
an
exceedingly
short
period
of
time
it
s
important
that
fire
doors
with
glass
are
able
to
work
immediately
and
can
be
certain
to
function
in
even
the
most
extreme
fire
scenarios
The
various
coatings
which
are
a
part
of
the
manufacturing
process
are
being
continually
developed
and
tested
by
experienced
and
qualified
fire
engineers
in
lab
conditions
which
mimic
real
life
fire
conditions
to
make
certain
that
at
all
times
the
door
and
accordingly
the
glass
contained
inside
fire
doors
with
glass
may
be
able
to
ensure
at
least
a
30
minute
integrity
and
insulation
period
of
time
in
the
face
of
fire
which
would
mark
them
out
as
an
FD30

door

The

by
Sam

Some
parents

think
that
mental

for
kinder
students
is
a
unnecessary
complication
to
the
lives
of
these
young
kids
They
believe
that
kinder
students
should
not
have
to
fret
about
memorizing
ideas
or
that
kind
of
thing
at
such
a
young
age
They
should
be
out
in
the
playing
areas
playing
and
being
youngsters
Well
all
of
these
are
true
But
is
mental
arithmetic
for
kinder
students
actually
a
complication
Is
it
really
something
that
s
too
early
to
expose
kids
at
Well
the
easy
answer
s
no
If
you
d
like
to
discover
more
about
mental
arithmetic
for
kinder
students
then
you
will
need
to
read
this
work
In
particular
we
re
going
to
discuss
the
different
scientific
studies
that
prove
mental
arithmetic
for
kinder
scholars
are
good
and
some
more
benefits
your
kid
can
get
from
it
Mental
mathematics
for
more
kind
students
is
typically
misunderstood
as
being
too
classy
for
the
mind
of
a
5
years
old
But
science
begs
to
differ
Are
you
aware
that
a
human
being
s
final
time
for
learning
occurs
in
the
first
3
years
of
life
During
this
time
70
of
the
brain
is
developed
From
four
years
old
to
five
20
more
is
developed
And
by
the
age
of
7
the
brain
is
absolutely
grown
and
developed
Ever
wondered
as
to
why
they
assert
kids
absorb
stuff
like
a
sponge
to
water
Well
that
s
why
Psychological
arithmetic
for
more
kind
is
essentially
a
very
nice
way
to
help
your
children
find
out
more
about
math
In
this
time
they
wouldn
t
be
too
exposed
with
the
traditional
method
of
learning
and
teaching
thus
making
it
easier
for
them
to
develop
the
right
methods
of
learning
Plenty
of
scholars
are
exposed
to
the
wrong
methods
of
learning
Heck
the
truth
is
we
are
all
not
conscious
of
how
to
learn
Faculties
or
teachers
don
t
teach
a
student
how
to
learn
They
just
teach
idea
but
rarely
will
you
find
someone
that
will
teach
you
the
way
the
brain
works
how
it
processes
information
and
how
we
remember
things
With
mental
arithmetic
for
kinder
scholars
they
are
going
to
learn
about
all
that
That
is
naturally
if
you
found
the
right
teacher
or
mental
mathematics
book
for
your
youngsters
Psychological
arithmetic
for
kinder
students
can
actually
help
them
realize
that
there
is
a
system
to
learning
more
efficiently
and
quicker
This
will
permit
them
to
finish
all
of
their
jobs
or
homework
less
complicated
and
at
less
the
time
Mental
arithmetic
for
kinder
student
can
sound
a
little
like
something
complicated
and
quite
frankly
scary
But
if
you
do
more
research
there
s
more
about
mental
arithmetic
than
what
s
written
here
you
ll
find
that
it
is
a
very
good
and
smart
option
for
your
kids
And
then
they
could
go
out
enjoy
play
and
act
the
way
youngsters
should
act

A
Big
Difference
in
pupils
results
after
having
a
math
tutor
by
Dalip
Somal
Does
your
son
or
daughter
need
to
have
math
tutoring
It
is
absolutely
nothing
to
become
embarrassed
with
Mathematics
is
one
of
those
subjects
a
large
number
of
individuals
have
trouble
with
While
some
folks
are
whizzes
using
numerical
equations
for
others
it
appears
as
if
the
tutors
are
communicating
a
foreign
language
Every
person
s
brain
is
unique
For
some
individuals
geometry
algebra
and
also
calculus
can
be
a
snap
nonetheless
they
cannot
create
a
good
dissertation
for
that
lifetime
of
them
For
other
people
they
may
be
capable
to
publish
sonnets
while
sleeping
however
count
out
arithmetic
problems
on
their
own
fingers
For
your
numbers
are
challenging
group
hand
calculators
might
be
as
indispensable
as
spectacles
It
isn
t
the
individuals
are
devoid
of
thinking
ability
they
re
merely
wired
differently
Charles
Darwin
the
science
brained
genius
which
masterminded
the
theory
of
evolution
was
one
wise
gentleman
Yet
were
you
aware
that
this
scientist
extraordinaire
could
not
graduate
from
college
because
he
couldn
t
pass
his
English
examinations
It
s
true
Many
people
get
math
brains
yet
others
have
literary
brains
unusual
exceptions
possess
both
If
your
little
one
falls
into
the
non
math
whiz
group
then
just
relax
She
or
he
just
needs
some
math
tutoring
With
the
aid
of
a
tutor
any
striving
pupil
of
numbers
could
progress
in
his
or
her
training
programmes
Mathematics
is
probably
the
subject
that
needs
to
be
completely
realized
at
each
and
every
point
The
Key
Reason
Why
it
is
important
is
really
because
the
next
step
associated
with
studying
will
likely
be
built
around
the
active
first
step
toward
knowledge
When
the
foundation
s
unstable
the
next
level
will
probably
be
even
shakier
When
a
particular
person
starts
to
sense
lost
with
this
subject
material
he
or
she
might
lose
self
confidence
and
begin
to
dislike
the
class
If
this
sounds
like
a
high
school
student
she
or
he
may
turn
to
miss
school
or
perhaps
hide
in
the
bathroom
to
stop
the
particular
distress
of
flunking
If
your
youngster
is
an
elementary
school
student
she
or
he
may
well
start
getting
unwell
all
the
tension
A
tutor
may
fix
the
building
blocks
of
knowledge
and
give
the
struggler
back
their
self
assurance
Because
standardized
education
and
learning
is
targeted
on
the
group
individuals
get
forgotten
Lecturers
typically
lack
time
and
energy
to
supply
added
TLC
to
the
strugglers
of
the
class
That
is
where
tutors
are
available
Parents
could
employ
a
one
on
one
instructor
for
their
kid
This
can
be
a
present
that
keeps
on
providing
due
to
the
fact
after
the
youngster
draws
up
he
or
she
can
take
care
of
the
classmates
as
well
as
get
back
self
confidence
Math
tutoring
venue
possibilities
may
be
inside
a
storefront
inside
a
room
at
the
school
set
aside
for
this
reason
or
perhaps
in
the
child
s
own
house
Numerous
services
provide
in
home
instructors
who
are
authorities
in
calculus
geometry
as
well
as
standard
mathematics
to
get
these
battling
students
on
top
of
things
There
are
numerous
choices
to
enhance
a
person
s
base
of
knowledge
in
order
to
proceed
steadily
ahead
in
class
We
re
not
skilled
in
each
and
every
subject
but
with
a
bit
of
added
help
each
can
still
do
well
at
school
If
mathematics
is
a
individuals
poor
spot
arranging
for
math
tutoring
can
turn
his
her
report
card
as
well
as
confidence
around

Corporate
Promotional
Gifts
You
ve
Come
a
Long
Way
Baby
by
Troy
Truman
The
practice
of
employing
corporate
promotional
gifts
has
been
around
for
a
really
extended
time
Thanks
to
modern
day
advances
the
gifts
have
come
improved
from
plain
calendars
Now
staff
can
supply
their
staff
wonderful
gifts
that
also
advertise
the
firm
normal
Not
merely
are
these
gifts
enjoyable
but
they
serve
a
practical
purpose
too
New
York
NY
is
well
known
for
its
industry
of
advertising
anybody
walking
down
Times
Square
can
attest
to
that
NYC
gives
over
over
the
top
advertising
even
so
It
really
is
house
to
a
lot
of
organizations
that
supply
organizations
with
special
gifts
that
display
logos
and
slogans
On
the
list
of
newest
methods
of
innovating
corporate
promotional
gifts
with
contemporary
technology
involves
the
use
of
silk
screening
This
might
be
used
for
prints
t
shirts
balloons
or
almost
any
other
type
of
porous
item
Even
though
some
strategies
call
for
stencils
and
inks
digital
imaging
and
ink
jet
printers
are
becoming
a
growing
number
of
well
known
as
a
result
of
ease
of
making
the
image
Companies
that
sell
t
shirts
to
tourists
in
the
Huge
Apple
depend
on
cost
effective
techniques
to
help
increase
sales
margins
NYC
offers
numerous
graphic
style
and
silk
screen
shops
to
select
from
so
compare
costs
and
top
quality
before
buying
An
additional
fun
corporate
promotional
gift
idea
may
be
the
flashlight
Flashlights
are
practical
presents
that
will
include
the
enterprise
logo
on
the
side
This
really
is
an
item
that
every
single
individual
really
ought
to
have
just
in
case
Some
of
the
types
of
flashlights
that
can
be
utilized
as
a
promotional
gift
are
bottle
opener
flashlights
a
flashlight
with
a
USB
plug
or
the
exceptionally
bright
LED
light
Face
it
who
has
ever
been
in
a
NYC
subway
station
at
night
and
wished
they
had
a
flashlight
handy
A
organization
that
advertises
their
logo
on
a
flashlight
is
utilizing
a
vibrant
concept
Among
the
more
amusing
kinds
of
corporate
promotional
gifts
could
be
the
poker
set
A
business
name
can
be
inset
on
the
chips
and
cards
and
this
is
a
excellent
example
of
combining
business
and
pleasure
The
subsequent
time
it
is
Friday
poker
night
break
out
the
poker
set
and
advertise
without
having
saying
a
word
If
the
visitors
snarls
of
Manhattan
gridlock
are
an
excessive
amount
of
grab
the
corporate
gift
tension
ball
and
relax
in
the
concrete
jungle
A
enterprise
that
offers
corporate
promotional
gifts
will
continue
to
provide
unusual
tips
for
its
clientele
and
can
preserve
clients
coming
back
for
much
more

The

Jobs

By
Means

To

by
Chas

Bear
in
mind
the
days
in
grade
school
when
your
instructor
would
regularly
inform
you
don
t
get
your
answers
from
the
internet
when
she
gives
an
task
And
as
much
as
you
rephrase
your
whole
homework
in
such
a
way
that
it
wasn
t
duplicated
from
the
web
she
still
discovers
and
gives
you
an
even
lower
score
As
appealing
as
it
appears
to
turn
the
laptop
or
computer
on
and
type
a
number
of
words
into
the
internet
search
engine
you
would
find
yourself
searching
through
your
closets
for
your
library
cards
so
that
you
can
begin
studying
and
researching
on
your
project
Ultimately
you
ask
Why
does
almost
everything
need
to
be
this
complicated
when
this
will
simply
take
me
a
few
minutes
if
I
used
my
computer
Today
though
it
is
no
longer
just
typical
truth
and
views
that
might
be
perfectly
located
at
the
Internet
but
jobs
also
Suddenly
individuals
are
now
saved
the
vexation
of
spending
for
transportation
expenses
and
are
given
the
alternative
of
doing
work
in
the
comforts
of
their
very
own
home
Earning
a
living
has
now
been
made
more
convenient
for
more
people
Though
online
jobs
are
not
all
high
paying
jobs
it
has
its
own
share
of
profits
one
being
that
it
appears
to
be
one
of
many
fastest
and
simplest
ways
to
ease
financial
worries
In
many
cases
online
jobs
don
t
require
solely
professional
skills
as
long
as
you
have
the
standard
understanding
in
computers
and
if
you
ve
got
experienced
fingers
on
a
keyboard
Now
that
it
is
nearing
2012
the
Internet
is
even
wider
than
all
of
us
probably
imagine
it
to
be
and
it
will
not
be
a
surprise
if
it
grows
even
more
It
s
now
a
big
accumulation
of
world
knowledge
and
the
business
sector
isn
t
one
to
be
left
behind
Increasingly
more
online
jobs
are
published
each
day
offered
to
job
seekers
Online
work
is
now
no
more
limited
to
call
centers
however
it
has
now
stretched
to
teaching
advertising
and
marketing
and
writing
also
Most
jobs
that
require
constant
contact
with
the
Internet
and
the
computer
itself
are
the
ones
in
the
creative
divisions
Web
developers
and
self
employed
writers
spend
almost
all
of
their
time
in
the
company
uploading
and
submitting
content
articles
to
online
glossies
right
and
left
while
web
developers
keep
a
close
attention
on
internet
sites
they
re
assigned
to
manage
to
make
certain
the
information
in
their
web
pages
are
up
to
date
Companies
are
studying
new
techniques
on
how
to
effectively
outsource
to
the
Philippines
and
they
are
now
employing
many
workers
along
the
way
In
the
event
you
decide
to
venture
into
writing
it
is
advisable
that
you
simply
do
thorough
research
on
companies
you
want
to
work
for
It
is
strongly
recommended
that
you
work
with
one
who
has
years
of
collected
experience
in
their
field
The
best
way
to
become
a
successful
freelancer
is
to
go
to
seminars
to
gain
knowledge
In
so
doing
you
learn
more
writing
tactics
and
principles
and
expose
yourself
better
to
the
industry
networking
allows
you
to
meet
people
and
build
contacts
Having
more
acquaintances
allows
you
to
market
yourself
in
the
industry
and
show
individuals
what
you
re
able
to
do
Also
it
is
advisable
that
you
create
a
portfolio
so
that
you
ve
got
a
powerful
assortment
of
works
that
you
could
happily
present
once
a
potential
employer
who
is
outsourcing
to
the
Philippines
requests
it
If
you
are
one
that
is
trying
to
find
a

steadfast
in
keeping
the
conveniences
of
home

What
I
said
was
true
Regardless
of
if
you
like
him
He
cross
dresses
and
I
think
he
is

Of
the

he
does
Skinny

anyone

Call
people
nuts
politically
correct
conspiracists
because
they
question
things
the
avg
person
doesn
t
bother
to
do
Anyone
care
to
wonder
why
the
song
was
played
8x
The
darkness
and
references
to
illuminati
cults
and
symbolisms
the
secrecy
the
overall
changes
in
Hip
Hop
I
adore
Kanyeee
but
he
s
acting
completely
different
And
before
this
even
became
a
thing
associated
with
the
music
industry
I
remember
watching
about
the
Freemasonary
on
History
channel
about
10
years
ago

Man
I
have
to
say
this
is
truly
Illuminati
inspired
music
It
is
filled
with
the
symbols
and
devil
worship
Not
cool
at
all
I
really
dislike
music
that
is
there
just
to
coruppt
the
masses
with
crap
like
this
Sorry
to
say
but
this
is
not
talent
It
s
all
just
negative
and
will
never
be
cool
It
seems
like
in
our
culture
and
media
what
is
bad
is
cool
but
if
people
open
their
minds
to
these
subliminal
messeges
in
the
music
they
listen
to
then
finally
people
will
start
to

Even
if
you
don
t
believe
that
the
Illuminati
exists
to
make
it
clear
and
simple
just
look
at
the
video
and
you
will
see
something
is
not
right
in
this
video
as
well
as
many
others
out
there
It
doesn
t
have
to
be
hip
hop
or
rap
it
can
be
any
kind
of
music
Look
at

Gaga
her

This
video
is
demonic
and
full
of
mind
control
Subliminal
messages
with
frequency
waves
thru
TV
and
if
you
dont
understand
that
then
they
have
accomplished
just
what
they
set
out
to
do
and
you
are
a
slave
Everything
thing
in
hollywood
has
a
motive
and
a
meaning
behind
it
My
head
is
hurting
and
that
is
not
normal
for
a
music
video
My
saying
this
im
not
downplaying
that
Kanye
is
not
talented

this

Tupac

when

coined
the
phrase
Killuminatti
Which
means
you

theorists

to
kill
the

talk
as
he
put
it
Go
educate
yourselves
on

educate

Are

crazy
Tupac
said
Killuminatti
because
he
was
trying
to
put
an
end
to
ni99
s
wasting
their
time
on
something
as
fiction
as
conspiracy
theory
He
wasn

against
the
illuminati
because
he
didn

believe
in

illuminati
He
was
against
a
bunch
of
ni99

wasting

on

You
people
have
it

I
say
killuminatti
because
how
can
a

sitting

in

to

Brandy
and
Monica
are
gearing
up
to
return
to
the
stage
together
and
perform
after
14
years
for
Clive
Davis
Pre
Grammy
Gala
on
this
Saturday
February
11
The
ladies
will
sing
their
classic
hit
The
Boy
Is
Mine
which
they
ve
only
performed
once
on
the
1998
MTV
Music
Awards
Plus
they
ll
sing
their
latest
duet
It
All
Belongs
To
Me
for
the
very
first
time
ever
Hip
Hollywood
caught
up
with
Brandy
and
Monica
during
their
rehearsals
along
with
Clive
Davis
and
got
the
inside
scoop
on
this
long
awaited
and
highly
anticipated
night
Clive
Davis
on
celebrating
Monica
Brandy
return
to
the
stage
We
never
really
had
the
opportunity
14
years
ago
to
celebrate
The
Boy
Is
Mine
the
way
that
we
should
have
It
became
a
really
old
time
best
selling
single
and
they
only
performed
it
once
before
on
MTV
So
the
opportunity
at
this
Pre
Grammy
Glala
the
night
before
the
Grammys
that
stands
for
the
best
in
music
really
has
performers
pairing
together
like
you
ve
never
seen
before
Really
very
few
people
have
seen
Monica
and
Brandy
sing
The
Boy
Is
Mine
It
was
wonderful
when
I
got
word
of
all
this
my
first
thought
was
lets
celebrate
Brandy
reuniting
with
Monica
Timing
is
everything
so
I
think
this
was
the
time
we
had
a
great
song
and
we
both
love
the
song
we
loved
the
subject
matter
and
we
just
went
from
there
It
just
feels
like
old
friends
magic
happening
all
over
again
in
2012
Monica
on
Whitney
Houston
showing
support
during
rehearsal
When
so
many
things
were
happening
in
my
life
that
weren
t
in
favor
of
me
reaching
my
full
potential
she
was
always
there
pushing
me
and
I
think
that
it
made
it
feel
good
when
she
was
in
the
audience
just
reminding
us
helping
us
with
sound
and
doing
different
things
today
because
their
expertise
hers
or
Mr
Davis
it
can
t
be
found
anywhere
else

I
was

with
this

I
really
had

of
who
was

Actually
Clive
s
pregrammy
party
is
more
exclusive
harder
to
get
into
than
the
Grammys
And
they
arent
performing
at
the
Grammys
to
be
honest
because
neither
is
nominated
etc
This
song
just
came
out
Monday
And
I
have
to
add
I
am
slightly
disappointed
with
the
new
song
as
well

I
was
speaking
about
their
new
song
the
other
day
and
someone
brought
up
how
similar
the
song
is
to
Beyonce
Irreplaceable
I
had
to
take
a
listen
again
and
it
is
quite
similar
which
makes
we
wonder
if
the
song
came
out
by
someone
else
would
the
opinion
be
different
The
song
is
actually
growing
on
me
but
it
took
at
least
12
listens
Boy

Both
these
ladies
have
put
out
better
sounding
material
than
their
recent
duet
but
it
wasn
t
supported
Now
they
are
taking
the
route
of
many
other
urban
artists
by
recording
music
that
will
appeal
to
the
pop
audience
If
you
don

your
favorite
artists
when
they
put
out
quality
music
don
t
be

when
they
start
putting

But
to
the

who
said

more
unfortunately
that

Moreover
